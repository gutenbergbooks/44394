IN THE GULF OF MEXICO</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It's</span> just like stepping suddenly into a strange
country. I am glad we came even if we decide not
to go into the business."</p>

<p>The speaker, a sturdy, manly-looking boy of eighteen,
was one of a party of four persons who were
strolling along a street in the Greek section of
Tarpon Springs, a small Florida town, located on
the Anclote River, a few miles from the Gulf of
Mexico. His companions were a boy about his
own age but of less robust appearance, a little negro
lad with a good-humored intelligent face, and a
middle-aged, heavily-bearded, blue-eyed man whose
tattooed arms and rolling gait told of a life spent on
tossing seas and whose confident bearing and air of
authority stamped him as one above the rank of a
common sailor.</p>

<p>Those who have followed The Boy Chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
through their many adventures will recognize in
the little party their old friends Charley West,
Walter Hazard, Captain Westfield and the Bahama
lad, Chris, who lately returned from a perilous trip
along the Atlantic beach searching for wreckage,
and now seeking some promising venture in which
to invest the Fifteen Hundred Dollars they earned
on that voyage.</p>

<p>"You're right, Charley," agreed the other boy.
"I didn't know before that there was a sight like
this in Florida. Here's a bench. Let's set down
and rest a bit. I am tired from walking."</p>

<p>"Golly, I reckon dis nigger's tired some too,"
chimed in the little darkey, "I'se dun had de toothache
in mah legs for most an hour, but I'se had to
keep up wid you-alls. Don't dare let you white
chillen prognostracate 'round a queer place like dis
alone."</p>

<p>The seat selected was a long bench standing on
the edge of the sidewalk, its back to the sandy street.
The four seated themselves at one end and gazed
around with eager interest at the strange scene, unconscious
of the curious glances bestowed upon them
by a large, deeply-tanned man, who, seated on
the other end of the bench, was languidly whittling
on a piece of white pine with a large sheaf knife.</p>

<p>The scene was one to arouse more than passing
interest. Up and down the sidewalk hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
swarthy-faced, powerfully-built men of all ages and
appearances, but all possessed of the same clear-cut
features and straight noses. Singly and in groups
of two and three, they hurried past, picturesque in
their bright-colored clothing with gaudy sashes
knotted about their waists. About all clustered an
air of energy and bustle uncommon to sleepy Florida
towns.</p>

<p>Built up close to the inner edge of the sidewalk
was a row of large buildings startling in their coats
of bright yellow, red, blue, and green paint.
Stretching away, close together in the distance, they
gave one the impression of a gigantic rainbow.
Through their wide-open doors and windows the interested
onlookers could gain a plain view of the interiors,
from which came the confused jangle of
foreign tongues. To the right of where the little
party sat was a busy grocery store, its windows
filled with strings of dried garlic, strange-looking
cheeses, queer nuts and fruits and a multitude of
eatables strange to American eyes. To the left of
them was a tobacco factory, the whirling machines
shredding up the huge brown leaves into hair-like
fibers and binding them up into pound packages.
Directly before them was a great hall filled with
little tables around which were seated groups of the
regular-featured men, playing cards, eating, or puffing
at strange pipes, with a small hose for a stem,
the smoke passing through great glass vessels partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
filled with rose water before it reached the smoker's
lips.</p>

<p>"That's the fifteenth place of that kind I've
counted to-day," remarked Charley West. "From
their numbers, one would imagine that these people
did nothing but eat and play cards."</p>

<p>"I'd like to try one of them pipes," said Captain
Westfield, wistfully. "I'll bet they give a good,
cool smoke."</p>

<p>"Let's go in and get dinner," Walter suggested.
"I am hungry as a wolf and that food smells
mighty good. You can try a pipe after we eat, Captain."</p>

<p>The man at the end of the bench shifted his position
closer to them.</p>

<p>"Strangers here?" he enquired.</p>

<p>"Just came in this morning. We're looking into
the sponge business a bit," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>Charley eyed the tanned man closely. There was
a sinister expression to the fellow's face, and his
eyes shifted uneasily away from the lad's level
glance. The keen-witted boy was not favorably
impressed with the stranger's appearance, but the
man's cordiality drove away his faint feeling of
distrust.</p>

<p>"I'll go in with you then," he offered. "Those
fellows don't speak much English and you would
have a hard job making them understand what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
you wanted. I know a little Greek and may be able
to help you out a bit."</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you," said the Captain, gratefully.
"We don't understand a word of their
lingo. I'll stand treat to the dinner if you'll eat with
us."</p>

<p>"It's a go," agreed the stranger, quickly. "Come
on. My name's Robert, Captain Roberts," he volunteered
when the little party were seated around
one of the tables, "I'm a retired ship's master."</p>

<p>Captain Westfield introduced himself and his
companions. "As I said, we are lookin' into this
sponge business a bit, but it's hard to pick out the
proper course from these twisted-tongued furriners,"
he said. "Do you happen to know anything
about it?"</p>

<p>"I used to be in the business myself," Captain
Roberts replied promptly. "I made enough money
in it to quit the sea for good."</p>

<p>"Then I reckon you're the very man to give us a
few pointers. Is there as much money in it as one
hears tell of?"</p>

<p>"More," declared the other. "These Greeks are
getting rich off sponging. It is not anything unusual
for a schooner's crew to clear up three or four
thousand dollars from a single trip. It takes quite
a bit of money to make a start, though."</p>

<p>"We have got a little change in our clothes,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
said the Captain, modestly. "Do you reckon a person
could get started good on a Thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"That would do nicely," declared Captain Roberts,
"and I can tell you just how to lay it out to the
best advantage, but let's order dinner first. We can
talk while we are eating."</p>

<p>He beckoned to a dark-skinned, ill-favored waiter
and gave an order in low-pitched fluent Greek.</p>

<p>The waiter was back almost instantly with a tray-load
of steaming dishes which he placed upon the
table. The boys could not determine the exact nature
of the strange viands, but they were too hungry
to be critical, and attacked the food with hearty
appetites.</p>

<p>"This mutton stew is delicious," Charley declared
as he took another helping. "I don't know
as I ever tasted anything better."</p>

<p>Captain Roberts grinned. "You don't want to
make any guesses about Greek food," he declared.
"That isn't mutton, but just tough old Billy-goat,
fattened on a diet of tin cans. These fellows have
the knack of fixing up such things so they can't
recognize them themselves. Just wait till the
coffee is served. You'll say you never drank any
better. But let's get back to that sponging business
now, Captain."</p>

<p>He and Captain Westfield were soon plunged in
a tangled maze of talk about schooners, diving boats,
sponges, and divers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys gave but little heed to the discussion for
their attention was partly diverted by the unusual
scene around them.</p>

<p>"It's just like being in another country," Walter
whispered to his chum.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't like the attention we seem
to receive," Charley replied. "Those fellows are
staring at us as though there was something wrong
in our being here."</p>

<p>The Greeks gathered around the other tables
indeed seemed more than casually interested in the
little party. They stared frequently at them and
their new acquaintance, and exchanged significant
glances and low words with each other.</p>

<p>"I guess we appear as odd to them as they do to
us," Walter said, carelessly. "There is a man who
is not a Greek. That fellow leaning against the
end of the counter in the corner."</p>

<p>The man indicated was unmistakably an American.
He was short, heavily-built and had a determined,
aggressive face. He was engaged in a heated
discussion with the proprietor of the cafe and his
heavy face was flushed with anger. As the boys
gazed curiously, he brought down his clenched fist
on the counter with a force that shattered some of
the dishes piled upon it.</p>

<p>"You needn't smirk, grin, and make excuses," he
thundered at the suave, smiling Greek. "You've
got to pay me that bill you owe me. It's been standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for months and I happen to know that you are
making money all the time, hand over fist. It's no
use pretending you don't understand me," he
shouted, as the smiling Greek shrugged his shoulders.
"You know what I say. If you don't come
up with the money by to-morrow night I'll close up
this place and have you prosecuted for obtaining
goods under false pretences. And it will not be any
use for you to try your nice little Greek trick of a
knife in my back in the dark. I go heeled and I
don't go to sleep when I walk this street. The
fellow who tries that trick on me will stop enough
lead to start a cartridge factory."</p>

<p>He turned and was walking towards the door
when his glance rested for a moment on the boys
and their companions. His glance swept swiftly
over each member of the little party. He paused,
hesitated a moment, then turning, walked swiftly
towards their table.</p>

<p>Captain Roberts rose hastily at his approach.
"There's a friend of mine over there," he said hurriedly,
"who I want to speak to. I'll be back in a
minute."</p>

<p>The approaching stranger noted his departure
with a grim smile. He stopped beside the Captain
and stood gazing down for one brief minute.</p>

<p>"Are you fools or strangers?" he demanded,
crisply.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>MR. DRIVER.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stranger's smile robbed his words of their
hardness.</p>

<p>"Strangers, yes," Charley replied, "Fools, no."</p>

<p>"No offense intended," said the man, quickly.
"Strangers will sometimes take advice but fools
will not. My advice to you strangers is to keep out
of places like this and not to make friends with
other strangers. I don't suppose you know who
that man is who just left you."</p>

<p>"He's a retired sea captain," said Captain Westfield.
"He was giving us some pointers about the
sponge business. Mighty pleasant an' obligin' fellow.
Mighty fair-spoken."</p>

<p>"Bless your simple little souls," exclaimed the
stranger. "He's no captain, active or retired. He's
the runner for this place. Lucky you haven't any
of you drank your coffee yet. You'd be waking up
in some alley bye-and-bye with your heads aching
from knock-out drops and your pockets turned inside
out. My, but you were easy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't reckon any one would dare do such a
thing in broad daylight," Captain Westfield declared.</p>

<p>"It's been done in this place a dozen times.
And the victim's kicks never did any good after it
happened, for there was always a dozen Greeks
ready to go on the stand and swear that it was only
a case of drunkenness on the victim's part. Better
get out of here."</p>

<p>The humbled little party arose and followed their
conductor out to the sidewalk. As they passed
through the crowd they could not help but notice
the wrathful glances the sitters bestowed upon the
one who had cheated them of their victims.</p>

<p>"I guess we have acted pretty green," Charley
admitted, as they passed outside, "but we were so
eager to learn about the sponge business that we
forgot caution. Besides, one does not look for such
tricks in a little town like this. It's not like a big
city where one has to be always on his guard against
strangers."</p>

<p>The stranger favored the members of the little
party with a closer scrutiny than he had yet bestowed
upon them.</p>

<p>"So you are figuring on going into the sponge
business, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We may try it a bit if we find out that it pays as
well as we have heard tell of," answered Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Westfield, cautiously, "but it's mighty hard to find
out anything definite about it from these Greeks."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's big money in it all right," said their
new friend. "You might make a go of it. You
are a pretty husky, determined-looking lot and
would soon get on to the Greekish tricks. It's a
risky business, though. I don't advise anyone to
take it up."</p>

<p>"We've encountered a few risks in other lines,"
said Charlie, modestly. "We are willing to take a
few chances if there's money enough in it to tempt
us."</p>

<p>The stranger pulled out his watch and looked at
the time. "My name is Driver," he remarked. "I
own a store over on the next street in the American
section. Business is slack at this time of day and I
will show you around a bit, if you wish. My clerks
can look out for the trade for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"No need of thanks," he said as the Captain accepted
his offer gratefully. "If you decide to go
into the sponge business, you will need lots of provisions
and I hope to sell them to you. We Americans
do not get any of the Greek trade and we are
always glad to secure a new customer. Now I suppose
you want to know about the profit side of the
business first. Well, I can not give you exact figures
but I know that all engaged in the business are making
big money. All these big buildings you see have
been built out of sponging, and they do not represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a hundredth part of the money made out of the
business. There is an enormous amount sent back
to Greece every month through the post-office and
bank here. I know Greeks who landed here only a
few years ago with nothing but the clothes on their
backs&mdash;and those were mighty poor&mdash;that are
wealthy men now and they made their fortunes out
of sponges. Oh, there's big money in it all right.
But you can look into that part of the business
closer later on. Now, I want to show you something
of the sponges themselves. We will go down
to the harbor first."</p>

<p>The interested little party followed him as he led
the way along a soft sand road flanked by scrub
palmettos.</p>

<p>Their guide paused beside one of the several large
buildings standing close to the road. "This is a
clipping shed," he said.</p>

<p>The building was open on one side and was filled
with a crowd of old men, women and young boys,
all Greeks. Before each was a pile of rough sponges
from which they were clipping the spoilt parts with
great shearing shears. In one corner, a man worked
over a big screw-press, pressing the severed fragments
of sponges into huge compact bales.</p>

<p>"That part isn't important enough to waste much
time looking at," Mr. Driver said, as he turned
away. "Come on and I'll show you something
worth seeing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>As they followed along behind their guide, the
boys became sensible of a strong, pleasant, appetizing
odor in the air, an odor which grew stronger as
they advanced. A turn in the road brought them
suddenly upon the source of the odor. On the shore
of a quiet little land-locked harbor, blazed dozens of
small camp-fires over which sat great iron kettles.
On pieces of canvas laid upon the ground were piles
of fresh beef and mutton. Over each pile worked
several Greeks cutting the meat with the sheaf
knives into tiny squares about an inch in size. Other
Greeks were dumping the little square pieces into
the kettles, while still others kept the contents stirred
and the fires under the kettles burning briskly.</p>

<p>"They are putting down the meat for their next
voyage," explained Mr. Driver. "They roast it in
its own fat, put it into stone jars, and pour the fat
over it. As soon as the fat cools and congeals it
forms an air-tight covering which keeps the meat
from spoiling."</p>

<p>"If it tastes half as good as it smells, it must be
delicious," Charley remarked.</p>

<p>Chris viewed the cooking operation with professional
jealousy. "Golly, I bet dey can't cook like
dis nigger," he declared, "I spect dem kettles ain't
none too clean noway."</p>

<p>Captain Westfield gave but scant attention to the
trying-out process. His interest was centered on the
big fleet of schooners anchored near shore. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
were over a hundred in number and were of all
sizes and designs. They made a pretty sight lying
gracefully close together in the little harbor. But
the old sailor soon strolled on to where groups of
Greeks were building and repairing boats on the
shore. He inspected their work with a critical eye,
but he was soon lost in admiration.</p>

<p>"Lads," he exclaimed, "I never saw such workmen
before. They are turnin' out tight, neat seaworthy
little crafts with no tools but a saw and a
hatchet. Ain't those queer lookin' crafts though."</p>

<p>The boats were about thirty feet in length, sharp
at both bow and stern, and of enormous depth for
their size. True to their love for bright colors the
Greeks had painted each plank a different hue and
the little vessels looked like floating rainbows.</p>

<p>The captain viewed their single masts, which inclined
aft at an angle of forty-five degrees, with
deep-sea scorn.</p>

<p>"It's clean against Nature for a mast to be set
that way," he declared. "It ain't regular or ship-shape."</p>

<p>"Those small crafts are used as diving boats,"
Mr. Driver explained. "They carry a big square
sail, but most of them are equipped with engines
also. They are great sea boats and will ride out a
gale almost as well as the schooners."</p>

<p>His explanations were interrupted by loud talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
close at hand and the little party, full of curiosity,
hastened to the spot from which the uproar came.</p>

<p>In the center of a circle of curious onlookers, a
large man wearing a marshal's badge was slipping a
pair of handcuffs on the wrists of a slender boyish-looking
young fellow.</p>

<p>"No need to put those things on me, Mr. Officer,"
the lad was protesting, passionately. "I'll go along
with you without any trouble. I've only acted
within my rights and all I want is a fair trial."</p>

<p>"Anything you say can be used against you at
your trial," cautioned the marshal.</p>

<p>"I don't care, I admit I shot two of those
treacherous Greeks. It was the only thing to do.
When it came on to blow a gale, they refused to cut
the cable, and work the schooner. It was a case of
making them obey orders and get her off before the
seas or lose my ship. I only wish I had shot more
of them. They have been laying for me ever since
to slip a knife into me and chuck me overboard. I
haven't dared take a wink of sleep for three days
and two nights."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," said Mr. Driver, as the marshal
led away his protesting captive. "I expect it happened
just as he says&mdash;an open mutiny, compelling
him to shoot&mdash;but every Greek in his crew will go on
the stand and swear that it was a case of cold-blooded
murder. Fortunately, the judge is wise to
Greek methods and the law deals gently with commanders."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"He looked mighty young to be a captain," said
Captain Westfield.</p>

<p>"It's this way," Mr. Driver explained, "the law
compels the Greeks to have an American captain for
each schooner and diving boat, and they hire the
youngest and, therefore, cheapest man that they can
get. It's a dog's life, out alone for months with a
gang that doesn't speak a word of English. As long
as the captain is content to be a mere figurehead he
can get along without serious trouble, but the minute
he runs counter to their wishes there is a row.
But time is flying, and I must get back to the store.
If you will come back with me I'll introduce you to
a man who knows more about sponging than another
American in the country."</p>

<p>"Just a moment, lads," said the Captain, as they
turned to go. "Which of those schooners do you
like the best?"</p>

<p>The two chums unhesitatingly indicated a beautiful
two-masted, snow-white schooner that seemed
to rest as loftily on the water as a floating swan.
The grace and beauty of exquisite lines marked her
out from the many shapely schooners surrounding
her. In large gilt letters on either side of her bow
was her name "Beauty".</p>

<p>"She's my choice too," declared the Captain. "I
wish we owned her. I ain't never seen a prettier
model."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>PREPARATIONS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as they got back into town, Mr. Driver
hunted up the man of whom he had spoken, and,
introducing him to each of the little party, hurried
back to his store.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was a young man still in his
twenties. He was a stocky, well-built young fellow
with an intelligent face, determined manner, and a
short, crisp way of speaking. He sized up the little
party with one quick appraising glance as Captain
Westfield stated their errand.</p>

<p>"If you are not willing to stand hardships, dirt,
discomfort, and danger, you want nothing to do
with sponging," he declared.</p>

<p>"We can stand anything that it pays us to stand,"
Charley replied, quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the right kind of spirit," approved
the young man, "but, of course you don't any of
you realize what you will have to meet. I've seen
others start in with the same confidence and get cold
feet before the first trip was over. It isn't any nice,
ladies' pink-tea business. It's a game for real men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but if the men are the right kind, they get their reward
for what they endure, all right, all right. I
landed here with an empty pocket and emptier
stomach, and now,&mdash;well, I am not a John D. Rockefeller
yet, but I've got enough laid by to keep the
wolf from the door for a good many years. Better
men than I have done better than I have. It's like
everything else, the best man wins, and wins something
worth winning, but, as I have said, it's no
business for nice, tender, little Willie boys, it's a
man's game."</p>

<p>Charley grinned in sympathy with the reliant,
independent spirit of the young fellow which was
close kin to his own traits. "We left off our short
pants last summer," he observed, gravely, "we are
fast learning to dress ourselves, and the Captain
there can even comb his own hair."</p>

<p>"Good," chuckled the other, "I guess <i>you</i> will
pass muster anyway, so I will give you some idea
of what you will have to expect. First, there is the
loneliness. For three months at a time you'll be at
sea without another soul to talk to, for there are
very few of the Greeks who speak English. With a
party like yours it would not be so bad for you
would be company for each other, but for the
American captains who go out alone with a crew
of Greeks, it's awful. I've known some to go crazy
for sheer loneliness, and few ever make a second
trip,&mdash;I'll never forget my first experience. Second,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sponging is a dirty business, the stench from dying
sponges will upset any but the strongest stomachs.
Third, there are the dangers, storms, accidents, and
troubles with the crew. I have never had any
serious trouble with my own men, but then I understand
their lingo and that counts for a good deal,
and, besides they all know me around here and
know that I will shoot first and explain afterwards&mdash;that
counts for still more."</p>

<p>"All that is interesting, but it ain't to the pint,"
said Captain Westfield. "The question is what can
one make off a trip. I reckon them little things
you're telling about is just details."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you'll find them pretty serious details,"
Mr. Williams said with a laugh, "but you are
right, the money point is the main thing. That's the
only thing that has kept me in the business. Well,
I had considerable <i>bad</i> luck last trip but I cleaned
up three thousand dollars. I've been doing better
than that."</p>

<p>The chums looked at each other with expressive
faces while Mr. Williams' keen black eyes twinkled
as he watched them.</p>

<p>"I seed a schooner down at the harbor," observed
Captain Westfield, carelessly. "She was a pretty
looking little craft and her name just seemed to fit
her&mdash;'The Beauty'. If she's good an' sound an'
for sale, I might be willing to give a thousand dollars
for her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Williams laughed, "You are not the first
sailor who has fallen in love with the 'Beauty'. She
is the finest ever. She has led the sponging fleet for
three seasons. Many have tried to buy her but
couldn't. You are in luck, however. Her owner
died last week and I have just received a letter from
his widow asking me to find a purchaser for her.
You can have her as she lays for thirteen hundred
dollars, and she is dirt cheap at that."</p>

<p>"Will you hold that offer open until ten o'clock
to-night?" asked the captain, "we will want to talk
it all over a bit."</p>

<p>Mr. Williams agreed to his request, and, after
thanking him gratefully for his information, the
little party took their departure.</p>

<p>"Back to the harbor," said the captain as soon as
they were out of hearing. "I want to take a good
look at the 'Beauty'. If she is anyway near as good
as she looks from a distance she's worth at least
twenty-five hundred dollars. Why we could make a
tidy sum by buying her, sailing her around to Jacksonville,
and selling her again."</p>

<p>They soon arrived at the harbor again where for
a quarter they hired a young Greek to row them out
to the schooner.</p>

<p>They found the little vessel all that her name implied.
She was about sixty-five feet long and broad
for her length. She looked more like a gentleman's
yacht than a sponging vessel and they were all delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
with her appearance. But pleased as they
were with her on deck, they were even more pleased
with her below. There, they found a large main
cabin with swinging lamps, hanging sideboard, easy
chairs, and comfortable furnishings. Opening into
the main cabin were found roomy staterooms, two
on a side, furnished with large bunks containing
springy mattresses. Instead of the small portholes,
common with crafts of her size, each stateroom was
provided with windows of heavy glass to admit air
and light.</p>

<p>Up forward at the foremast was the forecastle, or
crew's quarters. It was large, comfortable and well
equipped with bunks. Aft of it was the cook's galley,
containing a good stove and plenty of pots, pans
and kettles. Everything was exquisitely neat and
clean. But Captain Westfield was not content with
a mere survey of cabin and furnishings. He unfurled
several of the sails and examined the canvas
closely. He tested the strength of rope after rope.
He climbed aloft and looked over blocks, stays, and
running gear. Lastly, he descended into the hold
and examined all that was visible of the vessel's ribs
and planking.</p>

<p>"She's as tidy a little craft as I ever saw," he
declared, when he at last rejoined the boys back by
the wheel. "She ain't over six years old an' her
sails an' rigging are all new. She's worth twenty-five
hundred dollars of any man's money if she's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
worth a cent. All we have got to do it to buy her
and carry her around to some lively port an' we can
make twelve hundred dollars as easy as finding it."</p>

<p>"What's the use of selling her right off if we
buy her," Walter suggested, "Surely a few months'
use will not lessen her value to any great extent.
Why not make a couple of trips sponging in her.
I am anxious to have a try for some of that big
money they all talk about. We will never have a
better chance than now. At the worst, we would
only lose the price of a few months' provisions, we
would still have our vessel worth far more than we
paid for her."</p>

<p>"You've hit the nail right on the head," the captain
exclaimed, delightedly. "That's just what
I've been studying over, but I reckoned I'd wait an'
see if either of you boys proposed it."</p>

<p>Charley hesitated before agreeing to his chum's
proposal. "I confess, I am not so anxious to try the
sponge business as I was," he remarked. "First,
we know nothing about it ourselves, and would
have to depend entirely upon hired help&mdash;which is
a bad thing to have to do in any business. Second,
I don't like the Greeks, I don't like their appearances,
I don't like the reputation they have, and I
don't like the idea of being with a gang that doesn't
understand English."</p>

<p>"Bosh," Walter replied, lightly, "we will get
along all right with them. It isn't like one lone man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
being out with them, there are four of us and they
wouldn't dare start trouble with so many. As for
making them understand, why we can hire a man as
interpreter. I believe it's the best chance to make
money we've had yet."</p>

<p>"And I too," Captain Westfield agreed. "I
reckon we'd be foolish to let such a chance slip by.
That young fellow Williams says he's made considerable."</p>

<p>"But he made several trips and learned the business
before he went into it on his own hook,"
Charley objected. "However, I am not going to
hold back if the rest of you want to try it."</p>

<p>"Good," exclaimed the captain, "we will go right
back and settle the deal with Williams. We'll make
money off the schooner if we don't off the sponging."</p>

<p>They found Mr. Williams still in his office. The
thirteen hundred dollars was paid over and they received
a bill of sale for the 'Beauty', one diving
boat and everything the schooner contained.</p>

<p>"You've got a good boat at a mighty low price,"
he said. "There is no reason why you shouldn't
make well with her, if you just use common sense.
Doubtless, you have heard lots of hard things about
the Greeks, but I don't believe they are half as bad
as they are painted. Half of the trouble captains
have with them comes from their not understanding
each other. Get a reliable man to translate your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
orders, and you will get along all right although you
will find it a hard life. I wish I could help you
select your crew but I have to go to Tampa to-morrow,
and will not be back until the fleet sails. We
will see each other again on the sponging grounds,
if not before. I wish you the best of luck until we
meet."</p>

<p>The now tired little party bade the hustling young
man good-bye and repaired to the small hotel where
they engaged rooms and meals.</p>

<p>After supper Charley unpacked his valise and got
out the silver-mounted revolver presented to him
by Mr. Weston. He noted its calibre and sauntering
down to the hardware store purchased several
boxes of cartridges of a size to fit. He gave a couple
of boxes to Walter who possessed the exact duplicate
of his weapon.</p>

<p>"That's my first preparation for our trip," he
said laughing.</p>

<p>But, although he spoke lightly, he was troubled
by vague misgivings that their new venture was not
going to be the smooth sailing his companions believed.
For one thing, he doubted if rough, blunt,
quick-tempered Captain Westfield was just the man
to successfully handle the suave, oily, treacherous
Greeks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE START.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> have got to get a move on us," Captain
Westfield said as the four chums gathered together
at the breakfast table. "I've been out enquirin'
around this mornin' an' I've larned that the sponging
fleet sails in two days. Of course we don't have
to go with the fleet, but, bein' as it's our first trip
an' we're green at the business, I reckon, we had
better keep with the crowd an' learn all we can.
I've been up to see the United States Commissioner
an' got charts of the sponging grounds an' took out
papers for the ship. We're all officers on the papers,
lads. He put me down as captain of the schooner,
Chris is mate. You, Charley, are captain of the
diving boats, an' Walter's chief engineer."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be no mate," Chris protested.
"I wants to be de cook. Dat's schooner's got a
powerful fine galley an' a sight ob pots an' kettles.
Golly! I reckon dis nigger can fix up de grub better
dan any of dem ignorant furriners. A mate
ain't no manner ob count on board a little ship. De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
captain's always blamin' him for somethin' or udder
an' de crew always hates him. He's always in
trubble wid one or the udder. Now de cook's always
his own boss, he don't hab to stay out nights
in de cold an' de rain an' ebbery one is powerful perlite
to him, 'cause dey wants to keep on de bes' side
ob de one dat handles de grub. I'd rather be a cook
dan an ole mate any day."</p>

<p>"But you don't know how to rig up their queer
furrin dishes, lad," the captain explained. "They
ain't used to eatin' grub fixed up good like you fix
it."</p>

<p>"Golly! I reckon dat's so," agreed the little
negro, pompously. "I spect dey doan know much
'bout cookin'. Reckon dey wouldn't eat any more
ob der own if dey got a taste ob mine."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," the captain agreed craftily,
"an' we don't want to spoil them. Besides, I
reckoned you'd like to be mate. Why, I was at sea
ten years before I got a mate's berth. I reckon your
folks on Cat Island would be mighty proud to hear
that you were one an' was wearing a blue suit with
big brass buttons, an' a cap with Mate on it in big
gilt letters."</p>

<p>"Golly! I nebber thought ob dat," exclaimed the
little negro, delightedly, rising hastily from the
table. "I'se goin' to buy dem clothes right now an'
hab my picture took in 'em an' send 'bout twenty ob
dem to de folks on Cat Island."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"You got around that pretty neatly, Captain,"
Charley said, as soon as Chris was gone. "I expected
him to insist upon being cook. He thinks no
one else can do it so well. But, seriously, don't you
think we are all rather young to be ship's officers.
Men are quite apt to resent having to take orders
from mere boys."</p>

<p>"The law requires that those four offices be filled
by Americans an' we can't afford to hire men to fill
the places. Chris will be under my orders all the
time an' will be mate only in name. But you boys
are already smart sailors an' I expect you to be real
officers on your boats. If you weren't on the papers
proper you might have trouble with your men, but
the fact that you are regular commissioned officers
will make smooth sailing for you. Any refusal to
obey your orders would be mutiny."</p>

<p>"Very well, Captain," agreed Walter. "What
do you want Captain West and I to do next?"</p>

<p>"Just lay around an' enjoy yourselves this mornin',
I guess. The first thing is to get a fellow who
talks Greek an' to hire a crew. I want to pick them
out myself. As soon as we get them there will be
plenty to do stockin' up with grub an' water. Better
spend the time lookin' over your new command an'
pickin' up what you can about the business."</p>

<p>The advice was good, and, as soon as they had
finished breakfast, the boys hastened down to the
harbor to inspect the diving boats they had acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
with the purchase of the 'Beauty'. Upon a close
inspection, they were delighted with their new commands.
The little vessel was quite new and its
model promised great seaworthiness. Besides the
huge square sail it carried, it was equipped with a
ten-horse power gasoline engine. Its rig was different
from any the boys had ever seen, and they
spent several hours studying it, and making themselves
acquainted with the working of the engine.</p>

<p>"I believe I can handle it by myself now, if I had
to do it," Charley declared, at last. "The engine
may give us a little trouble at first, but we will soon
get on to it and it's likely there will be several Greeks
in the crew who know how to run it. Now, the next
thing is to settle on a name for our craft."</p>

<p>"I thought of calling it 'Flora'," Walter said,
with a little sheepish smile.</p>

<p>"And I was thinking of naming it 'Ola'," declared
Charley promptly.</p>

<p>After a spirited debate over the two names they
held in such esteem, the two lads at last came to a
compromise by agreeing to call their little ship "The
Two Sisters". This decided, they rummaged
around in the lockers until they found paint and
brushes with which they proceeded to letter on the
bow of their crafts the name chosen.</p>

<p>As soon as this task was finished, they returned to
the village and made a round of the shops purchasing
clothing for their trip, pricing provisions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
learning all they could from the various merchants
about the Greeks and the sponge business.</p>

<p>They were passing a little photo studio when
Chris' voice hailed them from inside. It was hard
for them to refrain from laughter at the figure the
little negro presented.</p>

<p>A common blue suit had been too tame a color for
Chris' brilliant-loving soul. He was clothed in a
pair of baggish yellow trousers, many sizes too
large for him, a coat of vivid scarlet hue, and a cap
of deepest purple. But in spite of his brilliant attire,
his little ebony face expressed deepest satisfaction.
On a chair beside him was a great pile of
finished tin-types and the Greek proprietor, beaming
at the unusual rush of business, was just adjusting
his camera to take another.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you want with any more of them,
Chris?" Walter exclaimed. "You've got enough
already to supply everyone on Cat Island."</p>

<p>"Dey ain't no good," replied the little darkey,
mournfully, "I 'spect dis man doan know his business."</p>

<p>Charley examined one of the despised tintypes.
"Why, they look just like you," he declared.</p>

<p>"Dey's just black an' white," protested the little
negro. "Dey doan show de colors at all."</p>

<p>The chums turned their heads aside to hide their
grins.</p>

<p>"That's a Greek camera, Chris," Charley said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with a wink at Walter. "You can't expect it to
take American colors. I tell you what to do. Just
write at the bottom of each picture: Pants, yellow;
coat, scarlet; cap, purple."</p>

<p>"Golly! I nebber thought ob dat," exclaimed the
little darkey, brightening. "But it hain't like habbing
de colors show," he added, mournfully.</p>

<p>The three were making their way back to the hotel
when their progress was arrested by piercing
screams coming from the rear of a large Greek
restaurant.</p>

<p>The boys hesitated and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Sounds as though someone was hurt pretty
bad," Charley commented, "but I guess we had better
go along about our business. We are likely to
get ourselves into trouble if we meddle with things
in this section," but as he spoke the screams rang
out afresh. The chums looked at each other; there
was no need for words between them.</p>

<p>"Well, it's foolish, but here goes," Charley exclaimed.</p>

<p>A narrow alley led into the rear of the building
and down it has hastened followed by his two companions.</p>

<p>A minute's walk brought them to the scene of the
screams.</p>

<p>In a little back yard stood a small Greek boy
about thirteen years of age. He was clad only in
short trousers and his bare back and legs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
covered with angry welts. Above him towered a
dark, scowling Greek, who was swinging a heavy
cowhide whip, while at each descent of the cruel,
stinging lash the lad's screams rose in piteous protests.
Clustered around was some dozen men and
boys looking on with unconcern.</p>

<p>Charley caught the Greek's arm as it rose for
another blow. "Stop that, you big brute," he cried,
trembling with anger. "You have no right to beat
a little fellow like that, no matter what he has done.
If you hit him another blow, I'll have you arrested."</p>

<p>"He won't understand you, Charley," Walter
cautioned.</p>

<p>But the Greek did understand. He turned a look
of the deepest hate on the plucky lad. For a second
he seemed in the act of striking him with the heavy
whip, but Charley did not flinch. "Try it, if you
dare," he cried.</p>

<p>The Greek lowered his upraised arm. "Why
should I not strike him?" He demanded savagely,
but in perfect English. "He is mine, I pay his fare
all the way from Greece. All day he plays on the
street and brings home no money. I will beat him
if I wish."</p>

<p>"You will not," declared Charley, firmly. "If
you do, you will be arrested very quickly. Lad, if
this man attempts to beat you again, you come to us;
you will find us on board the schooner 'Beauty'. If
she is not in the harbor you go to Mr. Driver who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
owns the store, I will tell him about you and he will
see that you are not abused. Do you understand
what I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I speak English good," the little lad
replied proudly. "He teach me so I can beg the
pennies."</p>

<p>The Greek's manner had suddenly changed. His
frown disappeared and he wore a smile that he endeavored
to make pleasant.</p>

<p>"The noble young gentleman need not worry," he
said, smoothly, "I love the boy and already regret
having whipped him&mdash;he is very bad. But it shall
happen no more."</p>

<p>"It had better not," Charley replied shortly, as he
turned away. "Come on, Walt, I am going to
speak to Mr. Driver about it now."</p>

<p>Mr. Driver listened to the lad's story with a very
grave face. "I'm afraid you boys have made a
dangerous enemy," he said. "That Greek is Manuel
George, and he is a very bad character. He was
arrested once for the murder of another Greek, but
they could not prove the charge against him although
everyone believed that he had done it. You
want to be very careful as long as you are in Tarpon.
I will gladly have him arrested if the boy
makes any complaint to me."</p>

<p>The boys found the captain waiting for them at
the hotel. "I've had the best of luck," the old
sailor declared. "I found the very Greek we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to make our orders plain to the crew. He talks
English as good as you or I. I did not lose any time
in gettin' his name on the ship's papers. He
promised to meet us here at the hotel this noon.
There he comes now."</p>

<p>The chums exchanged a glance of dismay, for approaching
their table, bowing, smiling, and as suave
as though they were his dearest friends was Mr.
Manuel George.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>THE START.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> captain introduced the boys to the Greek
who beamed upon them as though nothing unpleasant
had ever passed between them. The lads met
his smiling advances with a cold silence which the
captain noticed with puzzled concern.</p>

<p>As soon as he could do so without attracting too
much notice, Walter drew the old sailor to one side.
"We don't want anything to do with that man," he
declared, and he hurriedly told about the whipping
and repeated what Mr. Driver had said.</p>

<p>Captain Westfield looked troubled. "I wish I'd
known that two hours ago," he said. "He's signed
on with us now an' if I try to get rid of him he can
make a lot of trouble for us. We have got to take
him along. If we don't, he's liable to libel the
schooner an' cost us no end of money and delay."</p>

<p>Walter's face showed his anxiety and concern.</p>

<p>"He said he was going to bring a boy along with
him to act as cabin boy," said the old sailor after an
uncomfortable pause. "Maybe it will all work out
for the best. He won't be able to abuse the lad on
the schooner, an' I don't see how he can make us any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
trouble. All he's to do is to make our orders plain
to the men, it ain't as though he was an officer over
them."</p>

<p>"Well, if it can't be helped, we have just got to
make the best of it," Walter agreed, "I am going to
keep a mighty close watch on him all the time,
though. We will talk more about it later on. He
keeps glancing at us as though he knew we were
talking about him."</p>

<p>As soon as he got the chance, Walter told his
chum what the captain had said.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of that fellow going with
us," Charley declared, "but if it has got to be, we
had better start in by treating him friendly. It
won't help matters any to quarrel with him."</p>

<p>That was sound sense and the boys at once began
to treat the Greek pleasantly, in spite of the dislike
they felt for him.</p>

<p>There was no doubt but what the fellow understood
his position thoroughly. With his able assistance,
the captain, in a short time, secured a full
crew of fifteen men, including four professional
divers who brought their queer looking suits with
lead shoes and heavy helmets along with them.
The boys were pleased with the appearance of the
men. They were well-built, husky fellows and
looked to be capable sailors. They were much alike
in looks, all being broad-shouldered and swarthy
with clean-cut features and straight noses. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
alone seemed to differ greatly from the rest. He
was a tall, powerful, handsome fellow with unusually
small hands and feet. He seemed to be
shunned by the others and left very much to himself.
He was evidently a good sailor and when the
captain set his new crew at work to getting the
schooner ready for sea he performed his part with
a quickness and intelligence that won the old sailor's
approval.</p>

<p>As soon as the work was well under way, Charley
and Walter, taking the interpreter with them, went
back up town to purchase their stores. The bulk of
their purchases were made at Mr. Driver's store,
but there were many articles that he did not carry
in stock which they had to buy at the Greek stores.
Manuel directed them as to the kind of food their
crew were accustomed to. The bulk of the stores
consisted of ripe black olives in small kegs; queer
looking cheeses, rice, black flour and an abundance
of tea and coffee. The boys bought three whole
beeves and four lambs, directing that all their purchases
should be sent down to the schooner at once.</p>

<p>"Whew," whistled Charley as he paid the last
bill, "we have only got five dollars left of our fifteen
hundred."</p>

<p>"Don't you care," Walter replied, confidently.
"We will have a couple of thousand dollars anyway
coming to us when we get back, and still have the
'Beauty' besides."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys next visited the hotel and got their
valises and belongings which they carried down to
their new floating home.</p>

<p>They found that the Greeks already had the meat
cut up and sizzling merrily in the great iron kettles.</p>

<p>The new crew were a quick and willing lot and before
dark the last article was stored aboard, and,
with the diving boat towing along behind, they
dropped the schooner down the river to the mouth
and anchored for the night just outside amongst a
great fleet of schooners lying ready for an early
morning start for the sponging ground.</p>

<p>Long after they had eaten their supper and all of
the crew but the anchor watch had retired to the
forecastle, the four chums sat on deck admiring the
beauty of the scene around them. A thousand
lights twinkled from the fleet and high in the air
ahead of them the great lantern of the Anclote lighthouse
on its little island of barren rock.</p>

<p>Captain Westfield awoke the boys early next
morning, "Hurry up on deck if you want to see the
prettiest sight you ever saw," he said. The lads
hustled into their clothing and followed him up the
ladder. As they gained the deck they paused with
exclamations of deepest admiration.</p>

<p>It was blowing a stiff breeze and the blue water
of the Gulf was dancing and sparkling with white-crested
waves. Around them was the fleet all under
sail, their snowy canvas towering high above their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shapely hulls. Some lay with sails slatting, still
clinging to their anchorage while their brightly attired
crews worked over windlasses, reeling in the
dripping cables. Some already under way lay
hove-to in the open Gulf waiting for their fellows;
while still others, anchors tripped and sails drawing,
heeling over to the brisk breeze, darted away, sending
the water tossing and foaming from their bows.</p>

<p>The boys drew a long breath of pure delight at
the beautiful picture.</p>

<p>"It's grand," Charley cried.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad," agreed the captain with satisfaction.
"There's no place like the sea for beautiful scenes.
But thar ain't a ship in the whole fleet as pretty as
our own. Just watch her now."</p>

<p>The old sailor gave a few short orders which the
interpreter repeated to the crew. A dozen of them
sprang to the windlass, while others stood by the
halyards, ready to hoist the big jibs the second the
anchor broke ground. The "Beauty's" huge main
and foresails were already hoisted and her cable
hove short.</p>

<p>The men at the windlass shouted some words.</p>

<p>"Anchor broke," translated Manuel.</p>

<p>"Up helm," commanded the captain, "give her
the jibs."</p>

<p>The great sails mounted their stays, the
"Beauty's" head played off, and, careening over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
'till her lee rail touched the water, she surged
through the waters like a thing alive.</p>

<p>The chums watched the foam sweep past in transports
of delight.</p>

<p>"My, but she's fast," Walter cried.</p>

<p>"Aye, lad," the captain agreed, joyfully. "I
ain't never seen a faster, except maybe Black Sam's
schooner. We'll have to shorten sail in an hour if
we don't want to run away from the rest of the
fleet."</p>

<p>The boys watched with delight as the Beauty
overhauled and passed schooner after schooner.</p>

<p>As she surged past a large black-hulled vessel with
three diving boats in tow, a man on the stranger's
deck waved his cap and shouted,</p>

<p>"Good luck to you. Better keep with the fleet."</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Williams," Charley exclaimed. "I
am glad that we are going to be near somebody we
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is Mr. Williams," affirmed Manuel, who
was standing near. "But here is my little boy to
say that your breakfast is ready."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" Walter enquired of the
little fellow as they all followed him below. "I
could never remember that," he said, when the lad
replied with a very long Greek name. "I guess we
will have to call you Ben for short."</p>

<p>The band of chums were very hungry and they
seated themselves around the table before the steaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
cups of coffee and waited impatiently for the
food to be brought on, but the little Greek lad took
a position behind their chairs and waited.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Ben, and bring the breakfast," the
captain ordered.</p>

<p>"Breakfast there," the lad replied.</p>

<p>The old sailor repeated his order but Ben replied
as before.</p>

<p>"I reckon he don't understand," the captain remarked,
"Go up and tell your father, owner, or
whoever he is, to come down."</p>

<p>The lad was back in a minute with the smiling
Greek.</p>

<p>"We want our breakfast," the captain explained,
"the boy don't seem to understand."</p>

<p>"He understands all right, but, I see the cook
does not comprehend. It is the custom to have
coffee only in the morning on sponging ships."</p>

<p>"Nothing but coffee for breakfast?" roared the
old sailor.</p>

<p>"We eat but one meal a day and that at night,"
the Greek explained. "If the rest of the crew ate
the divers would want to eat also, and that would
be fatal for them. The stomach must be empty
when they descend to the bottom in deep water,
otherwise they die."</p>

<p>"Well, they can't see us eat an' I want my three
square meals a day," said the hungry sailor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"Right saving plan for us though if they only eat
once a day."</p>

<p>"They eat the whole three meals in one," the
Greek said with a smile. "I will speak to the cook
at once and he will soon have something ready for
you."</p>

<p>In a very short time they were served with a substantial
meal to which they all did full justice. As
soon as it was finished, they returned to the deck
where they learned that the "Beauty" was already
so far in the lead of the fleet that sail had to be shortened.</p>

<p>With Manuel's aid the boys picked out their
crews for the diving boat. They found that many
of the Greeks were familiar with gasoline engines
and they selected one of the youngest and most intelligent-looking
for an engineer. The four divers
were, of course, allotted to their boat, but besides
them they had to have two men to work the air
pump and two others to tend to the life-lines, which
made a crew of nine, besides the young officers, and
would leave only Captain Westfield, Chris and the
cook and five men on board the schooner.</p>

<p>The divers at once began preparations for their
future dangerous work. They examined pump and
air hose very carefully, for a slight leak in either one
would mean death by suffocation beneath the surface.
They brought out their diving suits and went
over them inch by inch for possible rents or tears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Many of the suits were old and covered with a multitude
of rubber patches. The boys were amazed
that their owners would dare descend in such worn
suits, but Manuel assured them that the patches were
so cunningly put on that not only would they exclude
water, but they would outlast the suit itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>FIRST TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the sailors Charley had selected for his
crew was the tall handsome fellow whom the others
seemed to shun.</p>

<p>"I can't understand what the rest have against
him," the young captain remarked to his chum.
"He seems very quiet and well behaved, and he is
every inch a sailor. I would ask Manuel about him
but it is bad policy to discuss one of the crew with
another. It always makes trouble. Likely, Manuel
would lie about him anyway, he seems to hate him,
look at him glaring at him now."</p>

<p>The Greek was leaning against the railing staring
at the sailor who was coiling down a rope near him.
Suddenly the Greek addressed the man in a low
savage tone. The sailor's face grew red with anger,
and he replied shortly in a few hissing words. With
a bound, the Greek cleared the space between the two
and struck the sailor full in the mouth. The man
reeled back against the main mast, but, recovering
himself in a second, sprang for his assailant. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Greek leaped to one side and whipped out a long
wicked knife.</p>

<p>Before he could use it, Captain Westfield, belaying
pin in hand, rushed in between the two.</p>

<p>"Put up that knife," he roared. "I'll do what
fighting there is to be done on this ship."</p>

<p>The Greek shot one quick glance at him, venomous
with hate, then he glanced beyond him at the
two lads who waited expectantly with hands on their
pistols.</p>

<p>"He cursed me," he said sullenly, as he slowly
replaced the knife in his pocket.</p>

<p>"When anyone curses you, report it to me an'
don't take the law in your own hands. I'm master
of this schooner, an' you might as well understand
it right off. Tell that fellow just what I've told
you."</p>

<p>The sailor's face darkened as the Greek spoke to
him rapidly, but he turned slowly away and walked
forward.</p>

<p>"That's a bad beginning," Charley remarked to
his chum. "I wish we had never seen that Greek.
I believe he insulted that sailor. The fellow was
behaving himself and tending to his own business."</p>

<p>He repeated the remark to the captain a little
later.</p>

<p>"I reckon you're right, lad," agreed the old
sailor, "that Greek seems to be a trouble-maker but
he'll find he's got the wrong man to deal with. I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
handled too many crews of tough roughnecks to be
bested by a dirty furriner."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he will keep you busy with complaints,"
Walter said. "How are you going to get at the
truth of it if he does complain about the others of
the crew?"</p>

<p>"You'll see, I reckon, he will try something like
that but I'm ready for him."</p>

<p>Sure enough, in less than an hour the Greek approached
the Captain.</p>

<p>"I hate to trouble you, but I must complain as
you have directed," he said suavely. "The cook,
he is very abusive, I tried to instruct him about
your meals but he answers me with vile names."</p>

<p>"Bring the cook aft," Captain Westfield commanded.</p>

<p>Manuel escorted the bewildered-looking cook aft
with a look of sly triumph on his face.</p>

<p>The captain looked the man over appraisingly.
He was a broad-shouldered, well-muscled fellow.
He spoke to him briefly but the cook shook his
head. He could not understand.</p>

<p>The old sailor picked up a rope and spread it in
a big circle on the deck.</p>

<p>"This insulting of you has got to be stopped
right off," he declared, addressing the interpreter.
"Give me your knife."</p>

<p>The Greek surrendered his weapon.</p>

<p>"Now both of you get inside that ring and fight it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out to a finish," he ordered. "Lick him good for
calling you names."</p>

<p>Manuel's face fell, and, turning he spoke rapidly
to the cook. "He has apologized and my honor is
satisfied," he declared.</p>

<p>"All right," the captain said with a wink at the
grinning boys. "Next time any one insults you,
I am going to make you give him a good licking in a
square fist fight. I'm not agoing to let any of the
crew swear at you and call you names&mdash;it ain't
right."</p>

<p>"I guess we won't have any more complaints
from him right off," he chuckled as the disappointed
Greek retired forward.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're going to have more or less
trouble through not understanding their language,"
Charley said, gravely. "I don't believe he had a bit
of trouble with the cook. He was just aiming to
have you punish the fellow and get you disliked by
the crew."</p>

<p>"I can handle him all right," the captain declared,
confidently. "If he gets troublesome I'll
iron him and put him down in the hold. I reckon I
can make the rest understand what I want done by
signs, though it would be mighty awkward if a gale
struck us."</p>

<p>The old sailor soon left the boys in charge of the
deck and went below to write up the log and look
over the charts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"If this wind holds we'll be on the edge of the
sponging grounds by night," he said when he returned.
"I didn't realize before how big they are.
Why, they reach clear from Cedar Keys to Cape
Sable, about seven hundred miles."</p>

<p>"One thing that has puzzled me is that all these
schooners seem to come from Key West," Charley
remarked, '"Of Key West' is lettered on the stern
of every one of them."</p>

<p>"Key West used to be the headquarters for the
sponging business in the old days," the captain explained.
"They used to gather sponges different
from what they do now. A schooner would take
out about twenty small boats an' a crew of forty
men. When she got to the sponge grounds, the
small boats would scatter out around her, two men
in each boat. One man would do the sculling and
the other would lean over the bow with a water
glass in one hand&mdash;a pail with a pane of glass for a
bottom&mdash;and a long pole with a hook in the end in
the other. When he spied a sponge on the bottom
through the glass he'd have the other stop sculling
and he would hook it up with his pole. It was
slow, hard work, but they made money at it until
the Greeks came with their expert divers. They
could not compete with them so they either sold or
leased their schooners to the Greeks and went out of
business."</p>

<p>The old sailor's explanation was interrupted by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
howl of "Oh, Golly!" from the cook' galley forward
and Chris, dripping with water, bounded out
of the open door of the little structure, and rushed
aft.</p>

<p>"I want you to put dat cook in irons, Massa Captain,"
he cried. "He's done 'saulted his superior
officer."</p>

<p>"What did he do to you," the captain asked with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Throwed a hull pan of dirty, nasty dishwater
obber me. I was jus' tellin' him how he had outer
do, an' tryin' to show de ignorant man how to cook,
when&mdash;slosh&mdash;he let fly dat big pan full all obber
me."</p>

<p>The dirty water was streaming from the little
negro's brilliant clothing and his face was streaked
with purple from his cap.</p>

<p>The captain checked his desire to laugh.</p>

<p>"The cook did just right," he said, gravely.
"You've got no business in his galley. A cook is always
boss there. Even the Captain seldom interferes
with him."</p>

<p>Chris seemed inclined to protest indignantly, but
the old sailor continued.</p>

<p>"How would you like to be cook an' have some
one poking around an' tellin' you what to do?"</p>

<p>"Golly! I reckon you is right," the little darkey
admitted, "I wouldn't stand such doin's. 'Spect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
dough dat my good clothes is all spoiled. Dat
water was powerful greasy."</p>

<p>"Better dry them out and lay them away," Walter
suggested. "They are too fine to wear at sea.
You had ought to save them 'till we get in port."</p>

<p>Both boys were glad when Chris accepted the suggestion.
They could see that the crew regarded the
little fellow in his gay apparel with a contempt and
ridicule that the plucky, loyal little lad did not deserve.</p>

<p>Under her shortened canvas, the "Beauty" had
dropped to the rear of the fleet. Late in the afternoon
the schooners ahead began to shorten sail.
Soon one rounded up into the wind, dropped anchor
and lowered sail. A mile further on another one
anchored, a mile beyond another took in sail, until
at last the whole fleet was strung out in a long line
reaching many miles North and South.</p>

<p>The captain held the "Beauty" on her course
until the last schooner was passed then anchored,
lowered sails and made everything snug.</p>

<p>"We are on the sponging grounds," he explained
to the boys who had been puzzled by the fleet's
maneuvers. "To-morrow we make our first try as
spongers."</p>

<p>As soon as their supper was finished the boys
strolled forward to view the crew at their meal.</p>

<p>The Greeks ate in groups of four. Each group
had a great tin pan filled with some kind of stew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
This they divided into four equal portions with their
big spoons, all eating from the same pan.</p>

<p>The stew, black bread as hard as a rock, and ripe
olives constituted their meal, but the boys, hearty
eaters themselves, were astounded at the amount of
food each Greek disposed of.</p>

<p>"I never dreamed a man could stow away so
much grub," Charley remarked. "They are not
eating three meals in one, but six."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>SPONGING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning sun rose over a scene of bustle and
activity. From the hundred schooners strung out
two or three hundred diving boats with sails hoisted
and engines chugging.</p>

<p>The young officers were up and away with the
earliest.</p>

<p>"Go slow," Captain Westfield cautioned them as
they stepped aboard their craft. "Keep your eyes
open an' learn all you can. Don't give any orders
unless they are absolutely needed. But if you have
to give them an order make them obey it, don't let
them trifle with you. You can take Manuel along
if you want to, I reckon I can manage to get along
without him."</p>

<p>But the boys declined the offer. They had both
taken a great dislike to the suave, smiling Greek.</p>

<p>The Captain had given their crew general instructions
before they left the schooner and the young
officers had but little to do but signify by waves of
their hands which direction they wished to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>All places looked alike to the inexperienced boys,
and as soon as their craft was a quarter of a mile
from the schooner, Charley signed to his crew to
anchor and proceed with their work.</p>

<p>The divers at once prepared for their descent to
the bottom. The lead was first hove to find out the
depth of the water, which proved to be about thirty-five
feet. Before donning their waterproof suits,
the divers tested the air pump carefully and examined
the air hose minutely, for upon these two things
their lives would depend when once they sank beneath
the surface. While they were putting on the
strange looking suits and heavy leaded shoes, the
crew slung short ladders over the sides. The divers
put on their headpieces last of all, these were large
globe-shaped coverings of metal with two heavy
glasses in front through which to see. But two
divers were to descend at a time. Their places
would be taken by two others at the end of two
hours, which is about as long as one can safely work
at a time beneath the surface. Those in reserve assisted
their companions in adjusting the heavy headpieces.
As soon as the helmets were on they screwed
in the air hose, and connected the other ends to the
pumps. A line by which to lower and raise them
was fastened around each diver's body and he was
then assisted onto the ladder, for it was almost impossible
for them to move in their cumbersome suits
and lead shoes. As soon as they had been helped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the lowest step on the ladder, each was given a large
basket to which a long line had been fastened, and
they were slowly and gently lowered to the bottom.</p>

<p>The young officers watched their operations with
eager interest. What impressed them most was the
vigilant care shown by the divers remaining on
board. One took charge of the tub in which the air
hose was coiled and paid it out carefully as the diver
sank, the other held the life-line instantly ready for
the jerks which would signal to him the wishes of
the one below. Not once did either's eyes shift or
his attention waver from his task.</p>

<p>"It's easy to see that this is a dangerous business,"
Walter remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes," his chum agreed, "I am beginning to see
that Mr. Williams was right when he said sponging
was a man's game. It certainly takes nerve to descend
like those divers have, knowing that there is
nothing between them and death but that little air
hose. But have you noticed how they are treating
that strange handsome fellow? They all seem to be
afraid to have him near."</p>

<p>The mysterious sailor had approached the men
working the air pumps, apparently with the purpose
of helping with the pumping, but the pumpers drove
him away with menacing gestures and upraised fists.
He moved over near the coiled air hose but the diver
in charge of that met him with a torrent of fiercely-uttered
words and he slunk dejectedly forward, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
seating himself by the mast, buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>"Poor chap," Walter remarked, "he seems to be
hated by the whole crew. I wonder what is the
reason."</p>

<p>"We will find out, I guess, when we meet up with
Mr. Williams again," his chum replied. "He will
likely know, or be able to find out quickly from some
of his crew. But look, we are about to see our first
sponges."</p>

<p>There had been a couple of quick jerks on the life-line.
The diver holding it called to one of the crew
who seized the line that had been attached to the
basket, and began hauling it carefully in hand over
hand.</p>

<p>The boys leaned over the side, eager for the first
glimpse of their future cargo. When the basket
came into view they both uttered an exclamation of
disgust and disappointment.</p>

<p>Instead of bright, clean, yellow sponges with
which they were familiar, the basket was heaped
with what looked like huge lumps of dirty mud.</p>

<p>The man dumped the contents out on deck and
lowered the basket down again.</p>

<p>"What greenies we are," Charley said as he
glanced at his chum's crestfallen face. "We might
have known if we had stopped to think, that sponges
have to be cleaned and cured before they look like
those we saw on shore. I expect that pile is worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a lot of money in spite of its unattractive appearance."</p>

<p>Five times did the basket appear loaded to the
brim before the divers' two hour spell below expired.
As soon as their time was up they were
hauled aboard, their suits removed and the other
two took their places.</p>

<p>"Whew, but I am getting hungry," Walter exclaimed
as noon time drew near, "and we came off
from the schooner without bringing a lunch with
us."</p>

<p>"I am glad we did," Charley said. "It's all
right having our meals regular when we are on
board the schooner and out of sight of the crew, but
it would hardly seem right to eat now before these
hungry fellows. I guess we can stand it to go without
dinner of they can stand it to go without both
dinner and breakfast. Besides, I don't believe I
could eat any lunch if we had it. Whew, but that
smell is getting awful."</p>

<p>The hot sun was getting in its work on the rapidly
increasing pile of sponges on deck. Adhering to
them were multitudes of muscles and little fish
which were beginning to send forth a fearful stench.</p>

<p>"I am beginning to realize that a sponger's life is
anything but a bed of roses," Walter laughed. "It's
easy to understand now why they only eat one meal
a day."</p>

<p>The novelty of the diving operations soon wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
off and the boys, to pass the time, busied themselves
with an attempt to learn something of the Greek
language. They selected the engineer for their
teacher. He was a young fellow with an intelligent,
good-humored face and seemed to take great interest
in their efforts. Touching different parts of
the boat and engine the boys repeated the English
names for them. The young fellow grasped the idea
instantly and repeated the names in Greek, laughing
heartily over their attempts to pronounce the
words after him.</p>

<p>In this manner the time passed quickly and pleasantly
and the lads were delighted with the rapid
progress they made.</p>

<p>"At this rate we will be able to speak the language
a little in a week's time," Charley declared.
"I'm&mdash;" but he never finished the sentence.</p>

<p>From around them rose cries that brought the
lads springing to their feet.</p>

<p>The crew were all crowded against the rail staring
as if fascinated over the side, while the diver
holding one of the life-lines was hauling it in with
feverish energy.</p>

<p>As the boys sprang to the rail, the diver's headpiece
appeared above the surface One glance, and
they understood the reason for the sudden commotion&mdash;from
the metal helmet dangled a short piece
of severed air hose.</p>

<p>The luckless man was quickly dragged aboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the head-piece quickly removed, and his rubber
clothing cut away, but his eyes were closed and his
face purple&mdash;he was dead. A long, weird, prolonged
wailing came from his shipmates which
arose and fell strangely, like the strains of the
mournful death march.</p>

<p>The two chums gazed at each other with pale,
horror-stricken faces.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow," Walter murmured, "His life
went out like a candle in a gale. Alive one minute,
dead the next. What could have cut that hose?"</p>

<p>"Chafed against a sharp branch of coral or bitten
in two by a shark," Charley replied, sadly.
"Well, I guess it means the last of our sponging,
the other divers will hardly want to go down after
such an accident, and I don't blame them."</p>

<p>But, to his amazement, as soon as the wailing
chant ceased, one of the remaining divers began
coolly to prepare to take the dead man's place.</p>

<p>"My, but those fellows have got nerve," he declared,
admiringly, but he stopped the man as he
began to put on his diving suit and by signs ordered
the crew to get up anchor and return to the schooner.</p>

<p>"It's only a couple of hours to dark and we have
had enough for one day anyway," he remarked to
his chum.</p>

<p>When the diving boat reached the schooner his
shipmates prepared the dead man for burial. The
body was sewed up in stout canvas and a piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
iron fastened to it. It was then gently lowered over
the side and sank slowly beneath the waves.</p>

<p>With its disappearance all vestige of gloom disappeared
from the crew. The dead man's scanty belongings
were brought forth and auctioned off to the
various bidders, and an hour after the crew were
chatting and laughing with each other as cheerfully
as ever.</p>

<p>"Mr. Williams was right, this is a man's game,
and a game for rough, fearless men only," Walter
remarked thoughtfully, for a second time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>TROUBLE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the crew had eaten their supper and rested
a bit, the captain had them transfer the sponges
from the diving boat to the deck of the schooner.
The sponges made quite an imposing pile which the
old sailor surveyed with satisfaction. "You've
done well to-day," he remarked, "if every day's
work is as good we'll have a valuable cargo before
our three months are up. I reckon, thar's all of
two hundred dollars' worth of sponges in that
heap."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you know how to clean and
cure them right?" Charley enquired.</p>

<p>"I don't, but Chris knows that part of the business
from A to Z. Where he comes from the people
live by sponging and pearl fishing."</p>

<p>"Golly, dat's right," observed the little darkey.
"I'se helped my daddy fix sponges many a time.
First off, you'se got to beat de mud out ob dem wid
sticks, den you got to let dem lay foah a day or two
to die, 'cause dey's alive jus' like fishes. When
dey's good an' dead, you puts dem in nets an' hangs
dem ober de side for de water to wash dem out clean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Den you dry dem out on deck an' string dem out on
strings 'bout two yards long. Dat makes dem all
ready for market 'cept for clipping de bad parts off
of dem, which is done on shore. Dar ain't nothin'
'bout fixin' up sponges dat dis nigger doan know."</p>

<p>Just then a small boat came alongside the schooner
and the boys hastened to the side to welcome the
two men it contained. They were the captain and
mate of the schooner anchored nearest to the
"Beauty". Both were young fellows hardly out
of their teens. They introduced themselves as
Steve Ward, and Ray Lowe.</p>

<p>"We thought we'd drop over and have a little
chat with you," said Ward, who was the captain.
"You, of course, don't realize it yet, but an American
face looks mighty good amongst this army of
Greeks, especially after one has been out for a
month or two. We all start out together but before
the season ends we get pretty widely scattered and
to meet up with another schooner with an American
aboard is like coming across a long-lost brother.
This is my fifth trip and I am getting pretty well
hardened to the loneliness now, but the first time I
was out I nearly went crazy. After we parted from
the rest of the fleet, it was worse than being alone
on a desert island, for I had the misery of seeing
others talk, laugh and enjoy themselves without
being able to understand a word. When, at last,
we came across a ship with someone aboard I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
talk to I nearly cried for joy. It seemed so good to
be able to understand and make myself understood
once more." His glance fell upon Manuel
George, who was leaning against the rail, and his
gray eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"What made you bring that fellow with you?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We had to have someone along who could talk
their lingo," Captain Westfield replied. "Do you
know him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything good of him," said the
other shortly. "I came near killing him once and
I've always half regretted that I didn't do it. It
was on my first trip," he explained. "It was just
such another case as that young fellow's who was
arrested the other day. Although I was captain,
the Greeks owned the schooner, and, because I
was young and inexperienced, they got the idea they
could run over me and do as they pleased. Manuel
was always stirring them up and encouraging them
to disobey orders. One day I had some words with
him about it, and,"&mdash;the young fellow's face darkened&mdash;"well,
he carries a bullet in his leg yet. The
others set on me and I had to lock myself up in the
cabin. Likely, they would have got me in the end
and thrown me overboard to feed the sharks, but
we happened to come across another schooner and
they had to let me go."</p>

<p>"He don't want to try any tricks with me," Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Westfield declared. "I got him to talk their
lingo but had him sign on as one of the crew. If he
tries to act up, I'll put him at the hardest work on
the schooner."</p>

<p>"Well, keep your eye on him," advised the other.
"He has never made a trip yet without making
trouble. He's a mighty bad egg and as sly and cunning
as he is mean."</p>

<p>The two men remained for over two hours, and
from them the little party learned many new and
interesting things about their new business and about
the Greeks.</p>

<p>"We have no reason to complain of a dull trip
so far," Charley said, when the two Americans had
left. "Only two days out and one of our crew is
dead, another is supposed to be on the watch to make
us trouble, and a third is a mystery worth solving,
judging from the way the others treat him. If
things keep on as they have started, we will have a
voyage exciting enough to satisfy anyone."</p>

<p>If the lad could have known of the exciting events
soon to follow close on each other's heels, he would
have had even less reason to complain of dullness.</p>

<p>The next day's sponging was the same as the
first. They seemed to have happened upon a spot
where the sponges were unusually plentiful. The
basket came frequently to the surface loaded with
the big mud-covered masses and by nightfall the
diving boat's deck was well covered. All day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
two lads persisted in their attempt to learn the Greek
names for the things about them. By night Charley
was able to direct the operation of getting under
way for the schooner. Of course, he was yet unable
to construct sentences in Greek, but he could call the
Greek names for sails, anchor, and different parts of
the rigging and the crew managed to guess the rest.
Though it was a crude and imperfect way of giving
orders, it succeeded better than the slow, imperfect
signs he had been obliged to depend upon before.</p>

<p>"If we keep on as fast, we will be able to make
them understand us well within two weeks," he declared
gleefully.</p>

<p>It was still light enough for them to see distinctly
when they reached the schooner, and they looked
about them with regret as they climbed aboard.
Her snow-white decks were filthy from the pounding
out of the sponges, and bulwarks, sails and rigging
were spattered with the foul mud, while the
strong, rank odor of dead fish hung heavy in the air.</p>

<p>Chris and the captain had just knocked off work.
Their faces, hands and clothing were black as soot.
The old sailor's face showed set and stern through
its coating of mud. He said little until all were
washed up and seated around the supper table.</p>

<p>"Well, lads, I reckon our troubles have begun,"
he remarked, grimly. "Manuel an' I had a row to-day."</p>

<p>"What about? How did it come out?" the boys
questioned, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I told him to help us with the sponge cleaning
and he refused to do it. When I insisted he flew
into a rage, cursed me, an' shook his fist in my face.
I couldn't stand for that an' he's down in the hold
now with the irons on him."</p>

<p>"Well, I feel easier with him there than with him
mixing in with the crew," Charley declared.</p>

<p>"My row with him ain't the worst of the matter,"
the old sailor said gravely. "I called on the crew to
help me iron him and they all pretended they didn't
understand my sign, but they knew what I wanted
all right. I had to handle him alone an' we had
quite a struggle before I got the best of him." He
rolled up his sleeve and showed an ugly-looking cut
on his arm. "He came near getting me with his
knife an' I had to give him a couple of taps with a
belaying pin. That cut don't amount to anything,
but what worries me is that the crew stood around
an' watched him try to kill me without interfering&mdash;it's
a mighty bad sign."</p>

<p>"That does look bad," Charley agreed, anxiously.
"I guess we had better keep him a close
prisoner and not let any of the crew go near him, he
might try to stir them up and make things hot for
us."</p>

<p>"But that means that someone will have to guard
him an' carry his meals to him. It wouldn't do to
have one of the Greeks do it, I reckon."</p>

<p>"No," Charley agreed, thoughtfully, "but I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I've got the very man for the job&mdash;that handsome
fellow the others seem to hate so. Manuel
tried to kill him and he is not likely to be easy with
him."</p>

<p>The mysterious sailor was at once sent for by
Ben. As soon as he came the captain loaded a tray
with food and a bottle of water and signed for him
to carry it and follow him. Charley and Walter accompanied
the two.</p>

<p>As they passed along the deck on their way to the
hold, they met angry glances and frowns from the
crew.</p>

<p>The mysterious sailor was very intelligent and
they soon made him understand that he was to
guard the prisoner. He grinned with enjoyment
and, seating himself a little way from the Greek,
took out his long keen sheath knife and laid it handy
beside him.</p>

<p>The prisoner's face grew black with rage at sight
of his guard, but he maintained a sulky silence.</p>

<p>"I guess he's safe enough now," the captain said
as they returned to their cabin. "I believe that
fellow will guard him faithfully. They seem to
hate each other like poison&mdash;I wish I knew the reason
for it."</p>

<p>"It would not seem so strange if the hatred was
confined to him and Manuel, but all the others seem
to share in the feeling," Charley remarked. "It
seems very queer to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>MANUEL'S RELEASE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the boys left the schooner next morning,
the guard they had set over Manuel approached the
captain, and by signs and gestures intimated that
the prisoner wished to speak to him.</p>

<p>Manuel's sullen demeanor had entirely disappeared
and he looked humble and penitent.</p>

<p>"I wish to make my most humble apologies to
you, noble captain," he declared. "All night long
I have thought over my hasty actions with shame
and regret. You were right and I wrong. I will
work hard at whatever you set me to do, and in the
future you will have no cause to complain if you
will set me at liberty."</p>

<p>There were tears in the fellow's eyes and his
voice trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Stop that blubbering," said the blunt old sailor,
who detested tears in men. "I reckon, if you are
sure that you've learned your lesson an' won't try to
act smart again, I'll set you free; but the minute
you try to start any trouble again, I'll put you down
here for keeps."</p>

<p>As he removed the irons from the prisoner, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
strange sailor burst into a torrent of passionate
speech.</p>

<p>The captain paid no attention to him for he could
not understand a word of it, but Charley, who was
watching closely, saw Manuel give the fellow a
quick glance of sly triumph.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you have made a mistake in setting
that fellow free, Captain," the lad said, as they returned
to the deck. "I believe it would have been
wiser to have kept him in irons until we could
touch some port and put him ashore."</p>

<p>"I never feel like being hard on a man when he's
sorry for what he has done," the old sailor replied.
"I guess it will make the crew feel better tempered
to have him set free. I'm going to put him ashore
at the first port we touch. In the meanwhile we'll
keep him hard at work an' keep a eye on him all the
time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better take him with us and put
him to work at the pump," Walter suggested.
"That's good hard work."</p>

<p>Charley approved the suggestion, for in spite of
the Greek's seeming repentance, the lad did not trust
him in the least and thought it wisest that he and
the captain should be kept separated for awhile after
their quarrel.</p>

<p>Manuel went at the hard labor at the air pump
with a willingness and cheerfulness which seemed
to show the sincerity of his repentance. At first, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
seemed inclined to talk overmuch with the rest of
the crew, but Charley cut short his talkativeness
with a curt command.</p>

<p>"I believe that fellow is a regular Jonah," he confided
to his chum during the noon hour rest. "Yesterday
and the day before we got lots of sponges,
but we haven't taken in enough this morning to pay
expenses."</p>

<p>"I guess this part of the ground is getting worked
out, perhaps," Walter replied. "I've noticed several
schooners pulling up anchor and getting under
way."</p>

<p>His surmise proved correct for during the afternoon
many of the fleet passed them headed North.
Evidently others were finding the ground as poor
as they did.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the captain recalled them
to the schooner with a signal previously agreed
upon,&mdash;a flag hoisted to the foremast head.</p>

<p>"I reckon we'd better be getting under way,"
the old sailor said when they got aboard. "I want
to keep with the fleet an' all the schooners seem to
be getting under sail. I've noted the course they
are takin' an' with this wind they'll be a long ways
from us if we wait until morning. I hailed one of
the captains and he said they intended to sail all
night an' anchor an' get to work early in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time the sails were all hoisted and the
anchor tripped, it had grown quite dark so the
schooner's great side-lights of red and green were
filled, lit, and lashed to the foremast shrouds, for,
with so many boats around them every caution must
be taken to avoid running one down, or being run
down themselves. The crew was divided into three
watches. Of which Walter was to have charge of
the first, from eight to twelve o'clock. Charley to
have command of the second, or middle watch, from
twelve to four o'clock, while the captain would take
the third, or morning watch, from four to eight
<span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>The breeze held steady and strong and the night
passed away without any exciting incident.</p>

<p>The boys were up again at first peep of day, expecting
to have to start out with the diving boat as
soon as the sun arose. But, when they gained the
deck, they found the "Beauty" still swinging along
on her course and the captain pacing the deck
greatly perplexed.</p>

<p>"It's mighty queer, but thar ain't one of the fleet
in sight," he exclaimed as he caught sight of the lads.
"I don't understand it at all. Go aloft, Charley, an'
see if you can see any of them."</p>

<p>The lad swung himself into the shrouds and made
his way up to the mainmast cross trees, but, although
he gazed all around, his eyes met nothing but the
broad expanse of the blue sparkling waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe we've run them all out of sight during
the night," he suggested when he regained the deck,
but the old sailor shook his head.</p>

<p>"The 'Beauty's' mighty fast, but she's not
speedy enough to do that," he declared. "Some of
those schooners were ten miles ahead of us when we
started. Besides, I shortened sail as soon as I took
my watch, because I did not want to get in the lead."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we have dropped away behind the rest,"
Walter said, but the others knew that that was impossible.
The "Beauty" was far too fast a boat to
be left so far behind.</p>

<p>The Captain examined the log. "We have come
a hundred and ten miles," he said. "Do you reckon
either of you boys could have made a mistake in the
course during your watch?"</p>

<p>"We didn't vary a quarter of a point from the
direction you gave during my four hours," Charley
declared. "I kept watch of the compass most of
the time and the needle held steady at North."</p>

<p>"I was careful about that, also," Walter said.
"We were headed exactly North during my entire
watch."</p>

<p>"Well, that compass is true," the captain declared.
"I tested it carefully before we left port. I reckon
thar's only one explanation; the fleet must have
changed their course during the night. We'd better
heave-to until noon when I can take the sun an' tell
exactly where we are at. It ain't no use trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pick up the fleet again, now they are out of sight&mdash;it
would be like hunting for a needle in a hay stack."</p>

<p>The crew were immediately set to taking in sail
and in a few minutes the little ship was lying head
to the wind under reefed foresail sail.</p>

<p>When the noon hour drew near, Captain Westfield
brought his instruments on deck and prepared to
take an observation of the sun. As soon as he secured
it he went below to work out their position on
the chart.</p>

<p>When he reappeared his face wore a very puzzled
expression. "Heave the lead and find out how
deep the water is an' what kind of bottom," he said,
briefly.</p>

<p>Charley took the lead, a heavy cone-shaped piece
of lead, slightly hollowed at the bottom, and with a
long line attached to the small end. Filling the
hollow end with soft soap, he dropped the lead over
the side and let it sink until it struck the bottom.
Then he pulled it aboard again, noting carefully the
water mark on the line and examining the soap to
which some particles of the bottom had adhered.</p>

<p>"Depth, six fathoms, (36 feet) bottom, soft gray
mud," he announced.</p>

<p>The captain strode back to the compass and stared
at it with a puzzled frown on his face.</p>

<p>"We're forty miles from where we should be,"
he said as the boys gathered around him, "Sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
neither of you boys made a mistake in the course last
night?"</p>

<p>"Sure," declared both lads positively.</p>

<p>The four puzzled over the strange situation in
silence for several minutes. Then the captain with
his knife loosened the screws and removed the compass'
face of glass.</p>

<p>"I wonder how that got there," he suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>Cunningly placed, so as to draw the magnetic
needle West of North was a small bright iron nail.</p>

<p>"It couldn't have got there by itself," Charley
declared, excitedly. "It must have been put there
by someone while we were all at supper last night."</p>

<p>"I guess there is no doubt as to who that someone
was," with an inclination of his head towards
Manuel who, standing a little ways off was watching
them closely. The Greek, as soon as he saw the
attention he was receiving, turned and strolled carelessly
forward.</p>

<p>The captain pondered gravely, "I don't see
what his object was," he said, at last. "If we held
on that course long it would only have carried us
further out into the Gulf, so he couldn't have been
aiming to get us wrecked."</p>

<p>"He planned to get us separated from the fleet,"
Charley declared. "Do you think we could find it
again, captain?"</p>

<p>The old sailor shook his head. "There's no telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
where we are now," he said, gloomily, "we
might hunt for days without coming across them.
If that fellow did put that nail there to make us lose
them, he's succeeded all right."</p>

<p>"What had we better do, captain?" Walter
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, we aint got no real proof that the fellow
put that nail thar so we can't do anything with him.
It might have been in thar all the time, though I'm
willing to take an oath that the compass was true
when we left port. Thar ain't much chance of picking
up the fleet again an' I don't reckon we'd better
waste time trying it. The lead shows we are still
on the sponge banks an' I reckon we'd best just get
to work, say nothing, an' keep a close watch on that
oil Greek chap."</p>

<p>The "Beauty" was anchored accordingly, sails
lowered and furled, and everything made snug. As
soon as that was done, the boys ordered their crew
into the diving boat and, running out a little ways
from the schooner, gave the signal to resume the
diving operations.</p>

<p>By sheer accident, they had chanced upon a spot
rich in sponges and the lads watched with satisfaction
the steady reappearance of the lowered basket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A RASH RESOLVE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys watched Manuel closely throughout the
entire afternoon, but they could detect nothing
amiss in his manner or actions. He did his work
willingly and cheerfully, humming a tune most of
the time, apparently he was at peace with himself
and the world.</p>

<p>They were not the only ones who watched the
Greek closely. Whenever the lads glanced at the
handsome sailor, they found him gazing intently
at the suspected man, much as a cat watches a
mouse, ready to spring at its slightest movement.</p>

<p>The boys kept well apart from the crew, watchful
for any threatened outbreak on their part. But the
men seemed so cheerful, willing and contented that
they soon grew ashamed of their distrust.</p>

<p>Once the handsome sailor approached them
respectfully, hat in hand, and, halting before them,
spoke rapidly in a low voice. The lads shook their
heads to show that they did not understand, and,
with a look of helpless resignation on his face, the
fellow returned to his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we could understand what he says,"
Charley said, wistfully. "He, evidently, has something
important he wishes to tell us."</p>

<p>"We will be able to make out what he says before
long," Walter said, cheerfully. "We are learning
lots of new words every day."</p>

<p>"Yes, we are getting along pretty well," his chum
agreed, "but we are not picking up the language near
as well as Chris. It's really wonderful how fast he
is learning."</p>

<p>The little negro and the Greek boy had become
great friends and Chris, naturally quick witted, was
learning with astonishing rapidity to talk to his new
chum.</p>

<p>"It's the best day we've had yet," Charley declared
as they returned to the schooner in the evening.
"We have got as many sponges this afternoon
as we have during any entire day."</p>

<p>Captain Westfield was elated over their success.
"It's turned out all right after all," he said.
"We've stumbled upon a mighty rich part of the
banks, an' I reckon, we ain't lost the fleet either,
as we feared, thar's some twenty sails coming up
from the South'ard."</p>

<p>The vessels, which the boys had not noticed before,
were approaching rapidly, coming before the
stiff breeze. Before dark settled down, they were
plainly visible but the eager watchers could not
recognize any of them, they seemed larger schooners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
than any they had seen in the fleet. The strangers
anchored for the night near the "Beauty" and the
captain got out his night glass and studied them
carefully.</p>

<p>"They ain't any of the fleet," he declared with
keen disappointment. "They're Spanish smacks
from Cuba. They fish around this coast regularly
every season."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll be some company, anyway, as long
as they stay near us," Charley said, cheerfully. "I
can speak Spanish if I can't Greek, we can go over
and call on them in the morning. I'd like to go
to-night, but I feel too tired out to move."</p>

<p>Soon after supper, Manuel approached Captain
Westfield, respectfully.</p>

<p>"We would like to go aboard the schooners, if
you will permit," he requested. "We are nearly out
of tobacco and the Cubans always carry a lot for
which we can trade."</p>

<p>The old sailor thought for a few minutes. "You
can go," he said, shortly, "you an' one man. Take
the dingy. I don't want the diving boat used. An'
be sure you're back aboard early."</p>

<p>The Greek thanked him effusively for the permission,
and, calling one of his shipmates, the two got
the schooner's little boat over the side and sculled
away for the nearest smack.</p>

<p>"They have got plenty of tobacco," growled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
captain, as soon as the two were out of hearing.
"Thar was enough sent aboard at Tarpon to last
them for months. I reckon he's figuring on deserting,
that's why I let him go. I'd be willing to lose
the boat and the other man to be well rid of him."</p>

<p>It seemed that the old sailor was correct for when
eight o'clock came Manuel had not returned.</p>

<p>"After what happened last night, I don't reckon
it's wise to leave the deck alone," the captain said as
the boys prepared to retire to their bunks. "One
of us had ought to keep watch to see that no one
monkeys with the wheel or compass."</p>

<p>Walter offered to take the first watch from eight
to twelve, and, leaving him pacing back and forth
aft of the mainmast, the others retired to rest.</p>

<p>Charley was awakened by a vigorous shaking and
his chum's voice calling to him to get up.</p>

<p>"My watch so soon," grumbled the lad sleepily,
"Seems like I just got to sleep."</p>

<p>"It's only eleven o'clock," said Walter in excited
tones, "but Manuel came aboard an hour ago very
drunk. He must have brought liquor with him for
they are all raising merry Ned in the forecastle now.
The captain and Chris are on deck. Hurry up,
there's likely to be trouble any minute."</p>

<p>Charley slipped hastily into his clothing and securing
his revolver ran on deck. His three companions
with revolvers in their hands were ranged across
the deck just aft of the mainmast. From the forecastle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
forward, came an uproar of shouting, cursing,
and fighting.</p>

<p>The old sailor was blaming himself, bitterly.
"I'd ought to have thought of it," he exclaimed,
"Auguident is cheap as water in Cuba an' those
smacks always carry a lot of it to trade off for other
things. What an old fool I was."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" Charley asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, but let 'em fight it out amongst themselves
an' keep 'em from crowding aft on us. Our
lives wouldn't be worth a pinch of snuff if we went
down to quiet them. If any of 'em tries to come aft
of the mainmast, shoot him."</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth when
a figure burst out of the forecastle and came running
aft followed by several others staggering, shouting
and cursing.</p>

<p>The captain raised his pistol and took deliberate
aim as the flying man drew near.</p>

<p>"Stop, or I'll shoot," he commanded.</p>

<p>Charley knocked aside his upraised arm. "Let
him pass," he cried, "it's the strange sailor, they
have been trying to kill him."</p>

<p>The handsome fellow was bleeding from a dozen
knife wounds, and was breathing short and heavily.
As he reached the little party of chums, he turned
about and faced his pursuers. It was evident that
he did not lack courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The pursuing Greeks stopped short at sight of the
little band stretched across the deck with leveled
revolvers. For a minute they seemed about to dash
forward regardless of consequences, but, after a
moment's hesitation, with a volley of curses they
turned and slunk back to the forecastle. They were
yet sober enough to realize the danger of open
mutiny.</p>

<p>"I don't think they'll try to bother us," said the
captain with a sigh of relief. "They ain't drunk
enough for that yet, an' I reckon they've about
drank up all their liquor by now. It wouldn't last
long amongst so many of them."</p>

<p>The strange sailor had sunk to the deck in a dead
faint, and, leaving the boys to guard the deck, the
Captain and Chris carried him below, and, laying
him in one of the bunks, hurried back to their companions.</p>

<p>"He ain't going to die," the old sailor informed
them. "He's just weak from loss of blood. I
didn't take time to look him over close, but I
counted nineteen knife cuts on his body an' likely
thar's some I didn't notice."</p>

<p>"We will have to keep him back aft with us.
They would likely kill him if we sent him back to
the forecastle, for he is unable to defend himself
now," Charley said, and his chums agreed with him.</p>

<p>The uproar in the forecastle continued for a long
time then gradually subsided. Evidently, the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
had disposed of the last of the liquor and its effects
were slowly wearing off.</p>

<p>Not until four o'clock, however, did the last noise
cease, and the little party of chums remained on
deck until the sun rose, ready for any violence from
the drunken Greeks. Daylight found them pale and
tired from their long, anxious vigil.</p>

<p>"Better go below, lads, and have a good nap,"
the captain advised. "They have all quieted down
and there is no danger of trouble for the present.
They are going to feel mighty sick and weak from
the drink."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to give them a chance to sleep
off their bad feelings," declared Charley, grimly.
"My crew have got to turn to and work as usual.
I'm going to turn them out as soon as Ben awakes."</p>

<p>When the little Greek lad appeared, looking pale
and frightened, Charley sent him below to rouse
Manuel.</p>

<p>The lad, apparently, did not relish the task but he
went, and, after a long time, reappeared accompanied
by the Greek.</p>

<p>Manuel plainly showed the effects of the liquor.
He looked sick and haggard and one eye was much
discolored from a blow he had received. He was
ready, however, with an excuse for the night's disorder.
"I did my best to stop the noise and trouble,
and it was thus I received a blow in the eye."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were drunk when you came aboard,"
accused Walter.</p>

<p>"I took a drink on the schooner," admitted
Manuel, "only one little drink. It was foolish, for
I am unused to liquor and it went to my legs, but my
head was clear. I regret the disorder of the others."</p>

<p>There was no doubt in the minds of the captain
and the boys that he was really the author of all
the trouble, but they could not prove it and Charley
dismissed him with a curt command to call the crew.</p>

<p>They were a sick-looking crowd when they were
at last collected on deck. All showed the effect of
the liquor and many were the black eyes and bruised
faces. Their fighting humor seemed to have departed,
however, and they went about their tasks
quietly, sullenly, and listlessly.</p>

<p>After they had finished their morning coffee,
Charley ordered his crew into the diving boat and
set out for the spot where they had found so many
sponges.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>A MYSTERY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two boys kept well apart from the crew,
and watched closely for any signs of threatened
trouble, but, although the men looked sullen and
ugly enough for any kind of act, they seemed much
subdued and went about their tasks quietly saying
little, even to each other.</p>

<p>"I guess we are giving ourselves a lot of worry
without cause," Walter remarked, softly. "Those
fellows seem quiet enough now. It was the liquor
that made them act as they did last night, but they
have drank it all up now and I do not believe we will
have any more trouble with them."</p>

<p>"I wish I could agree with you," his chum said,
gravely, "but I can't. I believe in the old Latin
proverb&mdash;'in vino veritas'&mdash;there is truth in wine.
I've always noticed that when a man gets intoxicated,
he reveals just the kind of man he really is.
If he is naturally quarrelsome when sober he is sure
to want to fight when drinking. If he is good-hearted
and kind when sober, he is generally good-humored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
when drunk. Liquor seems to destroy
a man's caution and make him reveal his real character.
Now these fellows showed plainly their feelings
towards us last night when they were drinking.
To-day they are sober and more cautious, but
I believe they feel just the same towards us. It
only needs some real or fancied wrong to bring their
hatred to the surface again. I believe if we had a
clash with one of them now we would have a first-class
mutiny on our hands; but, I guess, we had
not better do any more whimpering. They will
suspect that we are discussing them and it will not
improve matters any."</p>

<p>For awhile the sponges came up from below every
half hour, but towards noon a full hour went by
without the basket making its appearance. The
lads, at last, became somewhat alarmed at the delay.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they are in any trouble down
below?" Charley enquired of Manuel.</p>

<p>The Greek shook his head. "They would have
signaled if anything had been wrong. There, they
are signaling now."</p>

<p>There came several jerks on the life-lines and the
Greeks in charge of them pulled the divers up and
into the boat. The men had been below for only an
hour and the boys were puzzled to account for their
coming up before their time had expired. When
their head-pieces were removed the lads could see
that the divers were greatly excited. They spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
rapidly to those around them, and a hum of excited
conversation arose from the before listless crew.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Charley demanded of
Manuel, who seemed to be the most excited of all.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," was the quick reply. "The men
grew faint for a minute but they will be all right
soon. That often happens to one when diving."</p>

<p>The Greek's excitement was too great for such a
trivial cause and Charley decided promptly that he
was lying.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the divers resumed their head-pieces
and prepared to descend again. As they
stood on the ladders one of the crew handed one of
them a coil of light rope to the end of which was
attached a piece of light wood.</p>

<p>"What does he want with that buoy?" Charley
demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>"There's a bad hole in the bottom which he
wishes to mark so that there will be no danger of his
blundering into it," replied Manuel promptly, but,
again, Charley decided that the fellow was lying.</p>

<p>"There's something in the wind," he remarked
to Walter. "The crew seem greatly excited, and
Manuel, I am sure, is lying."</p>

<p>A strange change had suddenly taken place in the
crew's manner. Before, they had been silent, sullen
and listless, now, they were animated, their eyes
glittered with excitement, and they chattered back
and forth like so many magpies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel evidently noticed that the boys were
watching them closely, for he addressed them in a
low tone and their chattering ceased. They resumed
their work with something like a return of their
former manner, but it was easy to see that their
sullenness was now assumed.</p>

<p>The lads turned their attention to the course the
diver was taking, and watched for the appearance
of the buoy which would show the whereabouts of
the bad place on the bottom. The bit of wood soon
floated into view not a hundred feet from the boat.</p>

<p>Apparently, the divers were still suffering from
their faintness, for it was a long time after they
descended before the first basket load of sponges
appeared, and it was nearly an hour before the
second one was hoisted aboard.</p>

<p>"We are not getting many to-day," Walter
grumbled. "If we don't do better pretty soon, we
had better move and try another place."</p>

<p>"There is something queer doing," Charley declared.
"Just watch those life-lines and see what
you make of it."</p>

<p>The ropes which were fastened to the divers
showed plainly the direction taken by the men below.
The lines were kept faintly taut to permit of the
signals being clearly felt, and their slant gave an
accurate idea of just where the divers were working.</p>

<p>Walter watched for awhile, a puzzled frown
gathering on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," he exclaimed, "they are right on that
bad part of bottom, and they haven't stirred for the
last fifteen minutes."</p>

<p>The lads continued to watch the tell-tale lines.
For another fifteen minutes the ropes remained
motionless, then from their twitching it became
evident that the divers were once more moving
around. In a short time thereafter, the usual signal
was given and two baskets of sponges were hoisted
up.</p>

<p>"That's got me puzzled," said Charley, as the
peculiar performance was repeated. "I guess we
had better appear not to have noticed it. The crew
is not looking at us in a very friendly way."</p>

<p>The attitude of the Greeks seemed to be growing
hostile. Many were the unfriendly glances they cast
at the two lads and the boys could hear their names
repeated in the low-toned conversation going on.</p>

<p>The two lads retired to the bow where, though
they effected to be taking their ease, they kept on the
alert for the first signs of trouble.</p>

<p>Though nothing happened to further arouse their
fears, it was a trying situation and both were glad
when the time came to return to the schooner.</p>

<p>They found the captain and Chris both tired from
a hard day's labor cleaning sponges. The wounded
sailor was sitting back by the wheel, looking somewhat
pale and haggard, but not a great deal the
worse for his many wounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"His troubles' been sorter praying on his mind all
day," said the captain. "He got a hold of my pad
and pencil this morning an' he's been drawing
pictures of the fight and other things&mdash;here's one of
them."</p>

<p>The old sailor produced a crumpled piece of
paper from his pocket.</p>

<p>Walter examined the sketch closely. It was not
without a certain cleverness and was better than
one would expect of a humble sailor before the mast.
It depicted a struggle between two groups of men.
In one of the groups, the lad could recognize some
of the faces of the Greeks, who, armed with knives
and clubs, were assailing the other party. As the
lad bent over to examine the other group more
closely, he uttered an exclamation of surprise. At
first glance there was nothing startling about those
whom the Greeks were fighting, but a second glance
showed something familiar about the figures composing
it. He passed the sketch to Charley.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, that little group is intended to represent
us," his chum exclaimed. "See they are just four
in number. That big one with the beard is meant
for the captain and the little one for Chris, the other
two are you and I. Why, the likeness to us is quite
striking when you look at it closely."</p>

<p>"I believe he intended this for a warning to us,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Walter declared. "Where are the rest of the things
he drew, Captain?"</p>

<p>"I threw them all away, I didn't reckon they
meant anything," the old sailor replied, regretfully.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," said Charley cheerfully,
"we will get him to draw them over again. He
seems a very intelligent fellow. I wish he could
talk so as to tell us what the crew are saying now.
Just look at him."</p>

<p>The strange sailor was leaning forward listening
eagerly to the buzz of conversation going on between
the Greeks. The diving boat's crew seemed
to have conveyed the excitement under which they
had been laboring all day to their shipmates who
had remained aboard the schooner. Groups of two
or three were gathered here and there, talking
eagerly together.</p>

<p>Walter called the little Greek lad to him.</p>

<p>"What are the men talking about, Ben?"</p>

<p>The little fellow hesitated before replying. It
was plain that he was greatly troubled and
frightened. "They talk about nothing much," he
stammered.</p>

<p>Walter was pressing him with further questions
when his chum interfered.</p>

<p>"It's hardly fair to make him tell," he said.
"It might cause him a lot of trouble. His uncle
is glaring at him now, as though he would like to
kill him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing to be learned by watching the
crew's actions, so, signing to the wounded sailor to
follow them, the four chums descended to the cabin
where the Greek cook had supper waiting for them.</p>

<p>Charley was unusually quiet during the meal, but
when the Greek cook and Ben had at last retired
carrying the dishes with them, he arose and closed
the cabin door.</p>

<p>"Captain," he said as he returned to his companions,
"I am going down in a diving suit to-morrow."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>IN A DIVING SUIT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old sailor stared at Charley as though he
feared the lad had taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>"Why, you must be crazy," he exclaimed. "You
don't know anything about that kind of diving."</p>

<p>"I fancy there is not much to learn about it,"
Charley replied. "I've been watching the divers
closely and it appears very simple. The main thing
seems to be to keep the air hose clear. I've been
wanting to go down ever since the first day, and
the strange way the crew have acted to-day has
decided me to try it. I want to see what it is that
has so excited them."</p>

<p>"It's a fool notion and I ain't going to let you
do it," the captain stormed, but Charley only
grinned, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"It's no use scolding, Captain, I've quite made
up my mind to try it. I've been thinking it over the
whole day."</p>

<p>"I say you sha'n't do it," roared the old sailor.
"I'll put you in irons first, I'm captain of this
schooner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm captain of the diving boat," Charley
reminded him with a grin, "If anyone interferes
with my doings on my own ship it's mutiny, you
know."</p>

<p>"Walt, say something to get him out of that fool
notion," pleaded the old sailor, helplessly.</p>

<p>Walter turned to his chum with a twinkle in his
eye, "If you go down, I'm going too," he said,
decidedly.</p>

<p>"You're two young lunatics," the captain declared,
wrathfully. "You're bound to always run
yourselves into danger whenever you get a show.
Neither one of you will ever live to see twenty."</p>

<p>But, although he fumed and threatened for a long
time, the matter ended, as was always the case
when the boys had determined upon a thing, in
his, at last, giving a grudging consent to their plan.</p>

<p>Chris had followed his little friend Ben on deck
as soon as he finished his supper, but soon after the
discussion was ended he returned below grumbling.</p>

<p>"Dat white child ain't no fitten company to-night,"
he declared. "He acts plum scart to death
an' won't talk none tall."</p>

<p>"You go up and stay around the wheel, 'till we
come up," the captain ordered. "I thought you were
there all the time or I'd been up myself, I don't want
none of those fellows fooling around the compass."</p>

<p>When Chris had retired, still grumbling, Walter
brought out a pad and pencil and handed them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the sailor who had been watching their faces closely
during their animated debate.</p>

<p>The man seized them eagerly and bending over
the pad began to draw slowly with awkward, clumsy
fingers. When the sketch was finished he tore off
the sheet of paper and handed it to Charley whom
he seemed to recognize as the real leader of the
little party.</p>

<p>The lad examined the sketch with eager interest.
"He must be a very cheerful sort of fellow," he
remarked, as he passed it to his chum. "First, he
prophesies a fight with the crew, and, now, he has
got us all shipwrecked. Can't say much for his skill
with the pencil though; that hulk does not look
much like our pretty 'Beauty'."</p>

<p>The rude sketch pictured a forlorn, dismasted
wreck, covered with seaweed and with one side
badly stove in.</p>

<p>The sailor had immediately commenced upon another
picture which he soon passed over.</p>

<p>The boys looked it over but could not decide what
it was intended to represent.</p>

<p>"It looks like a box full of crackers," Charley
said with a grin. "Well, if he's decided to have us
shipwrecked, it's thoughtful of him to provide us
with something to eat."</p>

<p>But the sailor did not seem to regard it as any
laughing matter. He watched their expressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with a face full of concern, and, when Walter shook
his head to show that he did not understand the
sketch, he laid aside the pad with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>"He has given it up," Charley said. "We had
better go to bed, I guess we have a hard day ahead
of us to-morrow."</p>

<p>Chris was recalled from the deck and Walter
took his place while the others turned into their
bunks and were soon fast asleep. At midnight he
awakened Charley and at four o'clock Charley was
relieved by the captain. The watches passed away
without any alarm, but one thing struck both of
the lads as being curious. All during their watches
three or four of the Greeks remained on deck instead
of seeking their bunks as they usually did right
after eating supper. They sat around up by the
forecastle smoking and talking quietly together and
the boys came to the conclusion that they were
merely wakeful from the effects of the liquor they
had drank the night before.</p>

<p>The boys looked longingly at the tempting breakfast
served by the Greek cook, but as they had
decided to make the descent to the bottom that
morning they were obliged to be content with a cup
of coffee.</p>

<p>The captain and Chris followed them aboard the
diving boat. "We're going with you," the old
sailor explained. "It's a risky thing you're planning
to do an' I'd be too nervous and anxious about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
you to stay on the schooner. She will be all right
without us for a little while."</p>

<p>Manuel seemed to note the presence of the captain
and Chris with satisfaction. Before the boat was
shoved off from the schooner, he called the cook
to the rail and conversed with him a few minutes in
low tones.</p>

<p>But his satisfaction changed to frowning anger
when the boys began to don the diving suits.</p>

<p>"You are foolish to attempt to go down, young
sirs," he said, angrily. "It is dangerous, very
dangerous."</p>

<p>"We are the only ones at all likely to suffer,"
Charley replied shortly. "Tend strictly to your
pumping, when we think we need advice, we will ask
you for it."</p>

<p>Before his head-piece was adjusted, he found
opportunity to whisper to Walter. "We won't be
able to talk when we get below, so I want you to
follow me and do just what you see me do."</p>

<p>"I will," promised his chum. "My, don't these
things feel queer. I can hardly lift my feet, they
are so heavy. They make me feel helpless as a
little baby."</p>

<p>The divers adjusted the helmets to the lads' heads
and, assisting them to the rail, helped them down
the ladder, and lowered them gently to the bottom.</p>

<p>Charley laughed to himself as he caught sight
of Walter in the clear water. His chum looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
like some strange monster in the grotesque diving
suit. He waved his hand to him and Walter placed
one great paw over his helmet where his mouth was
supposed to be, to show that he was endeavoring
politely to stifle a laugh.</p>

<p>But the boys' merriment at each other's grotesque
appearance was quickly lost in admiration of the
strange scene about them.</p>

<p>It was as though they were standing in the midst
of a beautiful garden. Here and there were patches
of soft white bottom, like winding paths amongst
the marine growth. On every side of the bare places
rose lace-like sea fans of purple, yellow, and red,
and feather-like sea plumes swaying gently to and
fro to the motion of the water caused by the lads'
descent. At their bases lay scattered multitudes of
shells of every conceivable shape, size, and hue,
while, towering far above the riot of color, rose
mighty trees of snow-white coral among the
branches of which hovered golden, silver, crimson,
and every shade of fish, great and small, their fins
flashing gracefully as they darted to and fro.</p>

<p>For some moments, the lads stood motionless
drinking in the beauty of the wonderful garden, but
they had not descended merely to admire and
Charley, after a long look around, hauled gently on
the life-line until he had some hundred feet coiled
neatly at his feet. Walter, though not comprehending
his chum's plan, followed his example. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
ruse was to serve a two-fold purpose, first to lead
those on the diving boat to think that the two were
a considerable distance from the boat, and, second,
to deceive them as to the real direction taken by
those below.</p>

<p>As soon as Walter had got his life-line neatly
coiled down, Charley turned at right angles from
the spot and moved slowly forward for the place
where he calculated lay the supposed bad place in
the Gulf's bottom.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find that he could walk with
perfect ease and comfort. The suit, which had been
so heavy and cumbersome above the surface, now
rested on him lightly as a feather. He could have
walked with considerable speed had it not been for
the care he had to take to keep his life-line free and
clear from the numerous branches of coral. He
watched Walter anxiously to see that he used the
same care with the rope upon which their very lives
depended and he was relieved to see that his chum
used every possible precaution.</p>

<p>Although the water was clear as crystal, neither
lad could see far ahead at that depth below the
surface for it was too far for the sun's light to
penetrate brightly. Charley was almost upon the
rope with its floating buoy above before he perceived
it. He moved forward now with the greatest
caution for, if Manuel's statement was true, a hasty
step might plunge him suddenly into a nasty hole or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a dangerous patch of quicksand. But the bottom
did not seem any different from that over which
they had passed. The rope was fastened to a
branch of coral where there was no indication of
a hole or quicksand, but, a little beyond where the
rope was fastened, the lad could see dimly a large
black mass rising up from the bottom. Towards it
he slowly made his way, followed by his chum.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>A CLOSE CALL.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Charley's</span> eyes were becoming accustomed to
the semi-gloom and a few steps forward gave him a
clear view of the dark object. One glance, and he
turned to his chum with a cry which was lost in his
muffling helmet.</p>

<p>Before the two lads lay the wreck of a once
stately ship, her masts broken short off and a great
gaping hole in her side. She had evidently lain
long in her bed amongst the coral and sponges for
long tendrils of sea moss streamed out from her
barnacle-covered sides.</p>

<p>Someone had been there before them for the
moss and marine growth had been scraped from the
vessel's stern revealing the name, "Golden Hope".</p>

<p>Charley turned from the spelling out of the
indistinct letters to see his chum beckoning to him
wildly and he hurried to his side.</p>

<p>Walter was stooping over an opened box partly
filled with what had once been shining gold pieces
but which were now tarnished and almost unrecognizable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in their coat of gray slime. The box had
been recently torn open as was evident from the
freshly-splintered wood.</p>

<p>Charley sat down on the box's edge and did some
rapid thinking. The crew's excitement was now
accounted for. They had not come upon a rich
bed of sponges as he had suspected but had discovered
a treasure such as men for ages have fought,
struggled, and died to attain. The half emptied
box showed that the divers had already begun to remove
the gold. For a moment, the lad was puzzled
to know how they had been able to bring up what
was missing without its being seen. There were no
pockets to the diving suits and they could have
carried but a few pieces at a time in their closed
hands. A moment's reflection, however, brought
him to the only possible explanation; the gold must
have been sent up in the sponge basket hidden
amongst the lumps of mud from which it could
have been removed by the crew without much risk
of discovery. But it was not the removal of the
gold which gave the quick-witted lad the most concern.
The amount taken by the Greeks was likely
but a mere trifle when compared with that which remained.
It was the effects the discovery of such a
treasure would have upon an already unruly crew
that he feared. As he had said to Walter but the
day before, he believed it needed but a trifle to fan
the Greeks' growing discontent into open mutiny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Here was riches enough to tempt the most steady
band of sailors and it was but reasonable to suppose
that it would tempt the lawless Greeks to deeds of
violence and bloodshed. These thoughts surged
through the lad's mind in far less time than it has
taken to tell of them. He would have liked to have
talked the matter over with his chum and settled
upon the wisest plan to follow, but that was impossible
below the surface and signs were useless to
convey exact ideas. He must decide alone upon
their immediate course of action and trust to
Walter's quick wit to fall in with what he decided
upon.</p>

<p>Arising he turned to his chum and laid one finger
across his lips. Walter nodded his ponderous head-piece
to show that he understood the sign for silence
regarding their discovery.</p>

<p>Taking up his sponge basket, Charley retraced his
steps to the spot where they had descended followed
by his observant chum. Here the sponges grew in
abundance and he at once began to fill his basket,
an example which Walter immediately followed.</p>

<p>As he bent over to tear up an unusually large
sponge he became suddenly sensible of an agitation
of the water near him. Straightening up, he stood
frozen to his tracks with fear and horror. Not ten
feet from where he stood lay a gigantic shark, its
belly gleaming white through the clear water. Its
little green eyes were fixed upon him with a wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
unblinking stare. He let the basket drop from his
grasp and flung up his arms with an unreasoning
instinct to protect his head from the impending
attack. At his sudden movement the great fish
darted away. Evidently, it was equally as
frightened of the strange unknown monster it had
encountered.</p>

<p>The shock had left the frightened lad weak and
trembling and he had to rest a few minutes before
he could resume the filling of his basket.</p>

<p>As he placed the last sponge in the basket he
turned to signal to his chum to ascend, but Walter
was already gone, his figure, grotesque in the diving
suit, was already well up from the bottom and
shooting up with astonishing swiftness. At the
same moment Charley became aware of a strange
sickening sensation. He was choking and gasping
for breath. Before he could realize what had happened
the frightful sensation had passed and he
was able to breathe fully and freely, and he felt
himself being pulled swiftly to the surface.</p>

<p>In a moment he was hoisted above the surface,
hauled aboard the boat and his helmet removed.
The captain, white-faced and shaken was leaning
against the mast his revolver in his hand. Chris,
ashen-hued, and a sailor, was still pumping faintly.
Close beside the air pump lay Manuel in apparent
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" Charley cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Manuel keeled over in a fit or something," said
the captain, brokenly. "I thought you would both
be dead before we could get you to the surface. It
seemed ages before I could get Chris to the pump
and the fellows to hauling you up. They seemed
to move mighty slow 'till I threatened to shoot.
They maybe didn't understand what I said but the
sight of the gun made 'em more lively," he concluded,
grimly.</p>

<p>Charley walked over to the prostrate Greek and
stood gazing down at his upturned face.</p>

<p>"He has no business to faint when he's working
the air pump," he said savagely. "I guess I'll kick
him a good hard one in the face for punishment."</p>

<p>The manly lad had no such intention of carrying
out such a brutal threat but he wanted to test
whether the treacherous Greek was, as he suspected,
really shamming.</p>

<p>The prostrate man's features twitched, he sighed
heavily and rolled over on his side, Charley's suspicions
were confirmed.</p>

<p>"Captain," said the lad distinctly, "if anything
happens to Walter and I when we are below the
surface, I want you to shoot this man without the
slightest hesitation. He is the only one who can
understand your orders and he must be made
responsible for our safety."</p>

<p>"I'll shoot him the first time anything goes
wrong," the captain declared wrathfully, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
caught the wink of Charley's eye. "I feel like
killing him now, for the fright he gave me."</p>

<p>The shamming Greek did not seem to relish this
threatening talk. He showed signs of surprisingly
rapid recovery. In a few minutes he was able to sit
up and look around.</p>

<p>"I am overjoyed to find you both alive," he said
faintly to the two boys. "Everything grew suddenly
black before me when I was pumping and I
knew no more. It is my heart, it troubles me at
times. You young gentlemen must go down no
more, it is too risky."</p>

<p>"We have had enough of it for to-day, but we
may try it again to-morrow," Charley replied,
cheerfully. "It is very beautiful and interesting
down below."</p>

<p>"I hope you avoided the bad place on the
bottom," said the Greek, anxiously. "The divers
say it is a dangerous hole."</p>

<p>"You must think we are fools to venture near
such a place," said Charley, indignantly, and the
man looked greatly relieved.</p>

<p>Above all, the prudent lad wished to keep the
crew from thinking that he and Walter had come
upon the treasure. As long as they believed them
ignorant of its existence they would likely continue
the work of secretly removing it without open
violence.</p>

<p>He could not talk over the matter with his chums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
without danger of being overheard, and he was
forced to appear unconcerned and look on with indifference
while the divers sent up basket after
basket of sponges, in every load of which he was
convinced was hidden several hundred dollars of
the gold coins.</p>

<p>He greatly admired Walter's manner. The lad
chattered over the beautiful gardens they had seen
below without a hint in his voice or manner of the
secret they had stumbled upon.</p>

<p>From time to time the crew shot glances of scowling
suspicion at the little group, but they were
evidently reassured by the boys' cheerfulness and
apparent unconcern.</p>

<p>It was like sitting beside a powder mine with a
lighted fuse in it, and both lads were greatly relieved
when the long day dragged away to its close
and the diving boat was headed back for the
schooner.</p>

<p>They were met at the schooner's rail by the cook
who seemed greatly excited and who greeted them
with a torrent of rapidly spoken words.</p>

<p>Manuel listened with a look of sadness, real or
assumed, on his face.</p>

<p>"He says," he interpreted swiftly, "that the
wounded man went suddenly crazy this morning
and flung himself into the sea."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE DISCUSSION.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chums looked at each other in silent comprehension.
There was not a doubt in the mind of
either that the sailor had been made away with during
their absence from the ship. They recalled
Manuel's talk with the cook before they left the
schooner and the look of satisfaction in his face
when he learned that they were all going on the
diving boat. Even the captain was not slow to grasp
the horrible truth.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible business, but don't let on that you
suspect them," he whispered. "We've got to have
a long talk and decide what it's best to do." To
Manuel, he said, curtly, "I reckon, it's the fellow's
own business if he wanted to drown himself, so you
ain't got no cause to grieve. Better divide his
things up amongst the crew."</p>

<p>Although they were eager for a talk alone, the
four lounged carelessly about the deck, striving to
appear unconcerned, until the Greek boy summoned
them to supper below. They talked cheerfully until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the cook had retired bearing the empty dishes with
him. Then Charley arose and noiselessly closed
the cabin windows and door so that their words
would not reach the deck. Returning to his seat,
he called the pale-faced little Greek lad to him, and,
resting his hand on his head, said kindly,</p>

<p>"Ben, we are not going to repeat anything you
say to us, and we want you to tell us just what has
been troubling you the last few days."</p>

<p>The little lad burst into tears, "They'll kill me,"
he sobbed, "they'll kill me."</p>

<p>"They will never know you told us," Charley
assured him. "We will never let anyone know you
told us."</p>

<p>"They are going to kill you all," faltered the boy
as soon as he could control his sobs.</p>

<p>"Why do they want to kill us," Charley questioned.</p>

<p>"My uncle makes them mad. When you give
orders he adds lots of bad names and swear words
to them. He tells the crew that you always take
that sailor's part. He tells them you're going to
have them all put in jail when you get back to Tarpon.
He tells them you love that sailor and hate
Greeks."</p>

<p>"But why did they hate that sailor so?" Walter
questioned.</p>

<p>"He Turk," explained the lad. "Greeks hate
Turks."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The chums glanced at each other in swift comprehension.
They knew of the deadly hatred that
existed between the two races. A hatred that had
led to the bitter war in which the Greeks had been
badly beaten. They understood now why the handsome
sailor had been shunned by all his shipmates.
They could see, too, how the wily Manuel had used
their defense of the man to arouse the crew's resentment
against them. The cunning Greek had woven
about them a net of lies which it would be impossible
to explain away.</p>

<p>"Then they find gold," Ben continued, "that
makes them crazy. Manuel tells them to leave you
alone if you don't find out about the money, but kill
you if you do."</p>

<p>"The infernal rascal," exploded the captain.
"He goes in irons and down in the hold to stay 'till
we get to port."</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" cried the alarmed Greek lad.
"They kill you right off if you do."</p>

<p>"One thing more," said Charley, as the little
fellow's tears began to flow afresh. "Who killed
that sailor?"</p>

<p>But Ben did not know although it was evident
that he did not doubt that the man had been killed.</p>

<p>Charley waited until the lad had dried his tears,
then let him go with the caution to tell none of the
crew that he had told them.</p>

<p>"We are in the tightest fix of our lives," he declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
when Ben had gone. "It seems, from what
he says, that we are safe so long as they do not
suspect that we know anything about the gold but
I fancy that Manuel suspects that we have found it
and I do not believe we can count on their being
willing to let us reach port alive. The question is,
what had we better do."</p>

<p>"I don't understand all this talk about gold," said
the captain.</p>

<p>The boys hurriedly told of the discovery they
had made while the old sailor listened with sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>"Boys," he exclaimed, when their tale was concluded,
"you've found what will make rich men of
us all. I remember the excitement caused by the
loss of that ship. It happened twelve years ago.
For months tugs and steamers were scouring the
Gulf searching for her. She had cleared from New
Orleans for New York with two million dollars
in gold aboard."</p>

<p>"She might as well contain two million toothpicks
so far as we are concerned," said Charley,
impatiently. "I'd give up every cent of it willingly
to be safe in port this minute."</p>

<p>The captain, brought abruptly back to a realization
of their desperate situation, thought deeply for
several moments before he spoke. "We had ought
to be able to hold our own against them fellows," he,
at last, observed. "We are well armed and I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
believe they have got any weapons except their sheaf
knives which ain't no good except at close quarters."</p>

<p>"It is not open violence but treachery that I fear,"
Charley explained. "We have had two samples already
of the way they work. First in that stoppage
of the air hose and, second, in the making away of
that sailor. No, that Manuel is too cunning a rascal
to risk open rebellion when he can accomplish his
ends without any personal risk."</p>

<p>"Why not let them continue to get up the gold
and hide it as they have been doing?" Walter
suggested. "We can pretend that we do not know
what is going on. Then when we get to port we
can turn them over to the authorities and recover
the money without any trouble."</p>

<p>Charley shook his head doubtfully. "That will
not do," he said. "I am as convinced as I am that
I am living, that we would never reach port alive.
Manuel is too wise to take any chances and he
knows that they could not remove such a large
amount of gold from the schooner without arousing
suspicion. I believe he has entrusted the crew to
spare us for the present only because he thinks that
some of the fleet might happen along and grow
curious if we were all missing. Besides, it is
doubtful if any of them know enough about navigation
to sail the 'Beauty' home. Us boys, he probably
will not hesitate to remove at any time if he can
give the act the appearance of accident, like what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
occurred to-day. The captain, he will likely permit
to remain alive until near port. He will have a
long story made up to account for our disappearance
and the gold will likely be well hidden amongst the
ballast from where he can remove it without exciting
comment so long as we are not on board."</p>

<p>The lad spoke confidently for he was putting himself
in the place of the cunning Greek and reasoning
just what he would do in a like position.</p>

<p>"I've got it," exclaimed the captain in triumph.
"When they are asleep we'll batten down the forecastle
hatch on them and keep them there until we
get to port. We four can work the schooner in, I
guess."</p>

<p>"I tell you, you don't realize what a cunning
rascal that fellow is," Charley declared in reluctant
admiration. "He has provided against just such
an attempt. I did not understand the reason for it
last night, but I noticed that all during my watch
on deck there were three or four men hanging
around the deck up forward. It's a great stake
they are playing for and they are not taking the
slightest chances."</p>

<p>"I noticed the men hanging around," admitted
the captain, "but I didn't think much of it at the
time. Let's have your plan, if you've got one, lad."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we can't get out of this hole without
some violence and danger," Charley replied. "I
have been thinking over it all day and this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
only thing I can think of that seems to offer any
hope of success. First thing in the morning Walter
and I must descend to the wreck again and bring up
enough gold to pay off the men when we get to
port. It's a risky thing to do, but it is necessary to
carry out my plan. You see," he paused to explain,
"the men were shipped for three months and they
could demand pay for that time. We haven't got
the money and we have not gathered up enough
sponges yet to make up so large an amount. They
could tie the schooner up for their wages and make
us a lot of trouble and expense, a thing Manuel
would be sure to do."</p>

<p>"But they have got a lot of gold which belongs to
us, already," Walter suggested.</p>

<p>"We would have hard work to prove that it is
ours, and it would mean a lot of delay," replied his
chum quickly.</p>

<p>"Go on with your plan, lad," said the captain,
who perceived that Charley had thought over all
sides of the question with his usual clearness.</p>

<p>"After we have brought up the money. We will
use their own plan for bringing it up without its
being noticed&mdash;we will hang around and let them
go on with the work as usual all day, for it would
not do to fight it out on the diving boat. When we
get back to the schooner at night, we will bring
matters to a head. We will make them get up
anchor and sails and head back for Tarpon. There's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
bound to be trouble and plenty of it but we'll be
prepared for it and Tarpon is only two days' sail.
What do you think of the plan?"</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long for a chorus of
objections.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>A DESPERATE PLAN.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I don't</span> see that your plan is any better than
mine," Walter objected.</p>

<p>"To tarry along while they remove the gold
would give them time enough to remove us one by
one," Charley replied, "While by doing as I have
suggested they will have but little chance for
treachery, and, although we will be sure to have
trouble with them as soon as we order them to get
up anchor, I think we can manage to keep the upper
hand of them for the short time it will take to
reach Tarpon."</p>

<p>"Golly, dis nigger plum hates to run off an' lebe
all dat gole," Chris observed.</p>

<p>"We'll come back for it," Charley declared. "As
soon as we have paid off the Greeks and got rid of
them, we'll pick a crew of Americans and hurry
back."</p>

<p>"And while we are wasting time in getting a new
crew, the Greeks will have spread the news and a
dozen boats will be here before we can get back."</p>

<p>"You forget that the captain is the only one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
knows where we are by the latitude and longitude.
Without knowing that, fifty boats might hunt for
a month without seeing that little buoy. It would
be like looking for a needle in a haystack."</p>

<p>"Hang that pesky Greek," exclaimed the captain.
"He asked me this morning for the schooner's position,
an' I gave it to him."</p>

<p>Charley's face fell, "That fellow seems to think
of everything," he sighed. "But it's hard to get an
exact position by latitude and longitude alone, isn't
it, Captain?"</p>

<p>"A navigator is lucky if he hits within four or
five miles of the place he's aiming for. Of course
it can be done if one is extra careful, but I could
not swear to our exact position on the chart now,
'though I reckon I could come within a couple of
miles of it."</p>

<p>"Good," Charley exclaimed, "I guess, we can
make it impossible for them to find the wreck again,
if they should manage to get back before us. It
will mean a little change in my plan, though.
Instead of getting off to-morrow night, we will have
to wait until the next morning." He hastily outlined
his amended plan, which, after they had discussed
it carefully, his companions agreed was as
promising as any they could think of.</p>

<p>They had hardly finished their discussion when
there came a knock at the cabin door and Manuel
entered, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wished to enquire if the young gentlemen
intend to go down in the suits again to-morrow?"
he said, suavely.</p>

<p>"We haven't decided yet," Charley said, carelessly,
"Why do you wish to know?"</p>

<p>"Because, if you are, the air hose had better be
greased. If it is left dry for long the rubber sometimes
cracks and makes leaks."</p>

<p>"Then have it well greased," the captain ordered.</p>

<p>"I guess he's afraid of being shot if anything
happens, an' is taking every precaution," chuckled
the captain when the Greek had retired.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Charley, doubtfully, "but, I
confess, I am afraid of that fellow. I'll certainly
look over that hose carefully before I go down to-morrow."</p>

<p>When they ascended to the deck, which they had
forgotten to have watched in the excitement of their
discussion, they found Manuel and two of the
divers busily engaged in greasing the rubber air
hose with bacon slush from the cook's galley.</p>

<p>Charley's was the first watch on deck and, long
after his companions had retired to their bunks, he
paced back and forth aft of the main mast pondering
thoughtfully over the plan he had suggested.
It was the best he could conceive under the circumstances
but he realized that its execution would be
attended with the gravest dangers. Most of all, he
dreaded the proposed descent to the bottom for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
gold. He was convinced that Manuel had hit upon
some scheme to get rid of him and Walter without
danger to himself. Again and again the lad's
thoughts came back to the greasing of the hose. If
the operation was so important, why had the divers
not done it before&mdash;They were not the kind of men
to take any unnecessary risks in their dangerous
work below the surface. He had often noted the
care with which they had examined hose and pump
before each descent.</p>

<p>But, while the lad puzzled over the matter, he did
not neglect to keep a watchful eye upon the three
or four Greeks who lingered on the forward deck.
If he had needed any reminder of the peril of their
situation, it would have been found in the sight of
those watchful, restless figures.</p>

<p>Near the end of his watch, he gave vent to a low
exclamation&mdash;He had discovered the reason for
the greasing of the hose. For a few minutes he
was appalled by the cunning fiendishness which had
prompted the act. The two hoses lay coiled close
together in great heaps on deck. Sauntering over to
them, the lad stooped over each pile for a second,
then, straightening up, he resumed his slow steady
pacing.</p>

<p>At midnight he awoke Walter to take his place.
"I've solved it," he told him.</p>

<p>"Solved what?" asked Walter, sleepily.</p>

<p>"Their reason for greasing the hose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"To attract sharks and lead them to bite it in
two."</p>

<p>"The fiends!" Walter cried as the devilish
ingenuity of the plot dawned upon him. "What
are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, until we are ready to descend," his
chum replied, "then it will be too late for them to
practice another surprise for us."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are right," asked Walter,
doubtfully. "They are not sure that we are going
to descend, you know."</p>

<p>"I think Manuel feels pretty confident that we
will. If we fail to do so, he likely will find some
excuse for replacing the greased hose with new ones.
You can bet, he's got it all figured out. He is the
brainiest villain I ever met up with. Better hurry
on deck now, and keep a close watch out. There's
no telling what other scheme he's got hatched up."</p>

<p>Although he retired to his bunk at once, Charley
lay long awake. The morrow would be filled with
danger and his nerves were already growing tense
for the struggle which he foresaw. The Captain
had relieved Walter on deck before he at last fell
into a troubled slumber from which he awoke just
as day was beginning to break.</p>

<p>By the time it was light enough to see, he was up
and dressed and making preparations for the carrying
out of his hazardous plan. From the lazerette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
he procured a long coil of light rope which he
placed in one corner of his cabin. He next opened
up his valise and got out the ammunition he had
purchased in Tarpon and a small, but excellent
pocket compass. These he placed in his bunk where
they would be handy if needed quickly.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over, the diving boat was
brought alongside and all got on board except the
cook and four men left to take care of the schooner
and clean the sponges gathered the previous day.</p>

<p>"We have decided to go down and have one more
look at those sea gardens," Charley told Manuel
when the sponging ground was reached. "They are
beautiful enough to invite another visit."</p>

<p>The Greeks' face expressed satisfaction. "They
are beautiful," he agreed, "but the young gentlemen
are rash to go down. Let the divers take the
risks&mdash;they are paid to do it."</p>

<p>"We will be very careful," Charley said, cheerfully.
"Walt, we had better look over the hose
before we go down, the divers always do."</p>

<p>The greased hose had been recoiled in the tubs
and the boys proceeded to overhaul them, foot by
foot, searching them closely for cracks or punctures.</p>

<p>Walter was puzzled to comprehend his chum's
plan. After what he had discovered, surely he did
not intend to risk using the dangerous things, but he
was well enough acquainted with Charley's shrewdness
to hold his tongue and keep his face from betraying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his uneasiness. He felt sure that there was
a good reason for his chum's actions. He had but
just reached this decision when he came upon a
gapping hole in the hose. It looked much as though
it had been cut in two with a sharp knife.</p>

<p>"Here's a bad place," he announced. "It's lucky
I found it. Air can't be pumped through this thing."</p>

<p>"And here's a hole in mine, too," Charley declared
in accents so surprised that no one would
have dreamed that he had made both slits the night
before to serve as an excuse for the rejection of the
dangerous hose. "We can't use either one of them,
we'll have to get out the new hose."</p>

<p>Manuel's face for a second was a picture of
bewilderment and baffled rage, but in a moment he
was again suave and smiling. "I don't see what
can have made those cuts," he declared. "They
can be patched in a few minutes, however. It would
be a pity to throw away such hose, it is as good as
new except for those two little places which can be
speedily fixed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>TOO LATE.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">No</span> patched hose for me," Charley said, decidedly.
"If the divers want to risk using it, they
can."</p>

<p>It was not just the reply the wily Greek had expected
and he hastened to answer.</p>

<p>"You are right, it does not pay to take risks.
I will get the new hose and put it on."</p>

<p>But Charley was ahead of him. He did not intend
to give the wily Greek any chance to play tricks
with the new hose. He brought it out from the
lockers in which it was kept and, after examining it
carefully connected it to the air pumps and helmets.
Before putting on his head-piece, he tried the air
pump also. It proved to be in perfect working order
and sent the air gushing through the hose. Manuel
fastened the life-line below his arms, but Charley
called the captain to adjust the heavy helmet over
his head.</p>

<p>As soon as his feet touched the bottom, Charley
moved forward for the wreck, Walter at his side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Neither lad wished to remain below a second longer
than was necessary for they fully realized that they
were running a terrible risk in descending at all.
They found the box they had discovered the day
before entirely empty, the divers had brought another
out from the wreck's hold and broken it open.
The gold was in twenty dollar pieces and in a few
minutes the lads had transferred several hundred
dollars from the box to the baskets. It was hard to
resist taking more but the risks were too great to
permit it. Quickly hastening back to the patch of
sponges, they tore up several baskets full of the mud
and covered fungus and, making a slit in each with
their sheaf knives, stuffed in the coins. It was the
very plan the divers had followed but Charley had
decided that they would not be looking for the
adopting of their own trick. As soon as the last
coin was hidden and the loaded sponges placed in the
basket with others on top of them to complete the
load, Charley signed to Walter to ascend and stood
watching him until he had been drawn to the surface,
then he gave the signal to be drawn up himself.
He was raised a few feet up from the bottom then
he sank quickly back to the place from which he
had risen and he saw the end of the life-line dangling
in the water twenty feet above his head. <i>It
had been pulled loose from his body.</i></p>

<p>Charley stood for a moment looking at it in
terrified dismay while his quick brain took in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
awful significance of his position. Frightened as he
was, he could not but admire the quickness with
which Manuel had hit upon another scheme for his
undoing after that of the greased hose, had failed,
for he had not a doubt that the Greek had fastened
the life-line to him in such a manner that it would
pull loose with a hard jerk. He was in no immediate
danger of death for the air hose still connected
him with the surface and the fresh air still
came gushing in a welcome stream into his helmet,
but a moment's reflection convinced him that this
was not all of Manuel's scheme, for the Greek would
know that the captain and Walter would soon become
uneasy over his delay and would start an
investigation which would quickly reveal that the
life-line was no longer attached to him. Clearly,
the Greek had another card up his sleeve which he
would soon play and Charley waited for it with
every nerve strained to keenest tension. He felt
longingly of the air hose, wondering if the frail tube
would hold for him to pull himself up to the surface
by it, but he quickly decided that it would not
stand the heavy strain and to break it would mean
his instant death. Keeping one eye on the life-line
so tantalizingly out of his reach he moved slowly
forward until he stood beneath the diving boat which
showed like a dim shadow above him. Suddenly a
thrill of horror went through him, the diving boat
was slowly drifting away&mdash;Manuel had played his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
trump card. In a flash the terror-stricken lad comprehended
the situation. Some one of the Greeks,
under Manuel's instructions, had stealthily severed
the cable, relying on the boat's slow drift being
unnoticed by the captain and Walter until it had
dragged apart the frail air hose. But, just as
Charley had given up all hope and waited for the
parting of the hose which would mean his death, the
dangling life-line was jerked up out of sight,&mdash;his
companions had discovered a part at least of his
plight&mdash;upon their next actions depended his life or
death.</p>

<p>The next few seconds seemed like hours to the
helpless lad, then a dark speck appeared in the
water above him quickly growing in size until he
could see that it was Chris fighting his way downward
with long steady strokes and following the air
hose in his descent. The little negro was nearly exhausted
when he reached the bottom. Thrusting the
end of the line he had brought into Charley's hand,
he turned upward and shot to the surface like a
rocket. Charley whipped the line about his waist
and gave the signal to pull up. He was swiftly
pulled to the surface, hauled aboard the boat, and
his helmet removed. Chris, breathing heavily, was
standing by the mast, the water dripping from him.
Walter and the captain, pale with fear, stood close
beside him.</p>

<p>"Thank God, you're safe, lad," cried the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sailor, tears in his eyes. "We feared the air hose
would part before Chris could get to you. We had
just pulled on the life-line and found it had come
loose from you when we discovered the boat had
gone adrift. I reckon, she must have chafed her
cable in two against a sharp piece of coral. Queer
how everything happens all at once that way, sometimes."</p>

<p>It was clear the simple old sailor did not suspect
that the trouble was anything but an accident, and
Charley hastened to reply,</p>

<p>"All is well that ends well, but I've nearly had the
life scart out of me. I don't think I'll ever want to
go down again."</p>

<p>He was watching Manuel closely as he spoke and
he noted with satisfaction the expression of relief
on the Greek's swarthy face. If he could only keep
him from thinking that he knew anything about the
gold and had not discovered his treachery, he hoped
to be able to avoid open violence until they were
prepared and ready for it. He was convinced that
the Greek was too cowardly to risk the danger of
being shot in open mutiny so long as he thought
himself unsuspected and free to scheme their removal
without danger to himself.</p>

<p>The diving boat was worked back to her old
position, another anchor dropped, and donning their
suits the divers resumed operations below. When
they came to the surface at the end of their two hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
trick below they seemed strangely excited and conversed
eagerly with Manuel and the rest of the crew.
Charley was for awhile puzzled to account for their
excitement, but 'ere long the solution came to him.
Like all plans intended to deceive, his had contained
a fatal defect.</p>

<p>"Walt," he whispered to his chum, "those chaps
have noticed that some of the gold has been removed
from that box. We are in for trouble, now, I fear."
The Captain and Chris were warned to be on their
guard but it seemed that the warning was unnecessary,
the excited talk amongst the crew soon ceased
and the fresh divers quietly prepared for their
descent.</p>

<p>But in spite of the quietness, there was a tension
and earnestness in the crew's manner which made
the anxious little party of chums feel that they were
standing at the edge of a powder mine which might
explode at any minute.</p>

<p>"I would rather have open fighting than this
awful waiting," Walter whispered.</p>

<p>"We will have that soon enough," said his chum,
grimly. "It will come as soon as we try to make
them get the schooner under way."</p>

<p>The long anxious day at last drew to its close,
anchor was got up on the diving boat, and she was
headed back for the schooner.</p>

<p>As they passed a large piece of driftwood covered
with large black birds with very long necks, Manuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
pointed at them, "Those are fine eating," he said
wistfully. "If the young gentlemen could kill a few
it would give us all a great feast."</p>

<p>Walter looked at Charley who nodded assent, for
he was not loath that the Greek should witness their
skill with the revolver.</p>

<p>Both boys had practiced often with their revolvers
and were better than average marksmen. Their
pistols were automatics, a style of weapon with
which even the unskillful can shoot fairly accurately.
Walter fired six shots in as many seconds, killing
four birds and wounding one. Charley fired four
shots at the same time, killing two birds and crippling
a third. The rest of the birds took flight before
the boys could shoot more. The captain and
Chris emptied their pistols at the flying flock without
success.</p>

<p>The diving boat was run alongside the dead birds
and they were picked up by the crew. Manuel
seemed delighted, "The young gentlemen are
wonderful shots," he declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>OUTWITTED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chums hastened below when the schooner
was reached for they were eager to talk over the
next move to be made.</p>

<p>"Things have got to be brought to a head right
off," declared the captain when Charley had
acquainted him with his suspicions of Manuel's foul
play. "It's rank foolishness to linger along an' give
them more chances to work out their devilish tricks.
It's better to have trouble with them right now while
we are prepared than to wait and perhaps have
them take us unawares."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness the time for action is close at
hand," Charley agreed, "I could not stand this
anxiety and suspense much longer. Let's go over
our plan once more and make sure that we each
know our parts so that there will be no hitch when
we come to carry them out. Now as soon as we
have supper Chris and I will get into the dingy and
pretend that we are going to row around for fun.
We will pull back and forth until it gets good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
dark, then we'll gradually work out to that buoy.
We will cut it adrift, take it aboard, pull due East
from the schooner for a mile and anchor it again.
That will throw them way off the scent if they
should manage to get back here again before us,
while it will tell us just where to look for the wreck.
That part is easy, the trouble will come when we
get back to the boat. First thing we had better do
is to stretch several ropes across the deck from rail
to rail just forward of the mainmast. That will
delay and bother them if they should try to rush
us in a body. The next move will be to get Manuel
aft and get the irons on him. We had better get
him down here in the cabin to attempt that. As
soon as we get him helpless, we will carry him up
and make him give our orders to get up anchor and
get sail on the schooner. He's too great a coward
to encourage his shipmates to make a rush for us
so long as he is in our power. They may try it in
spite of him, however, when they realize that the
gold is going to be lost to them. If they do we will
have to fight them off while Chris tends to the wheel.
We don't want any bloodshed if we can help it but
we mustn't let them get aft of the mainmast, they
would make short work of us if it ever came to close
quarters. Do you all understand now what we have
to do?"</p>

<p>His companions nodded.</p>

<p>"Then we had better reload our pistols, fill up our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
cartridge belts, and get ready," he continued. "I'll
get the ammunition."</p>

<p>But in a moment he was back from his cabin, his
face pale and grave.</p>

<p>"How many shells have you got left in your
pistol?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"One," Walter replied, while Chris and the captain
broke open their weapons to show only empty
chambers.</p>

<p>"I have got three shots left, that makes four altogether,"
Charley said, hopelessly. "All the rest
of our ammunition has been stolen out of my bunk."</p>

<p>His companions grew as grave and pale as himself
at the announcement. With only four shots left
they were practically helpless in the hands of the
Greeks.</p>

<p>"There is just one chance left," Charley declared,
desperately. "We have got to get Manuel in
our power and try to control the crew through
him. It may work and it may not, but it's our only
hope. Chris, go tell him we want to see him here
in the cabin."</p>

<p>As soon as the little negro had gone, Charley
brought out a pair of handcuffs from his grip and
placed them in his pocket. "When I give the signal,
get them on him," he said. "I'll lock the door so
that he cannot get out or the crew come to help him.
He'll likely put up a fight and we'll have to watch
out for his knife, but the three of us had ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
be able to handle him. But hush, here they come
now."</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded on the companionway stairs,
the cabin door opened, and Chris appeared, closely
followed by the Greek. The little negro stepped inside
but Manuel paused on the threshold and swept a
keen glance over the assembled party. Perhaps
some instinct warned him of his danger, perhaps he
decided that the time had come for his last treacherous
move. With a quick leap, he sprang back
through the open doorway, slammed the door to,
and bolted it outside, and the little band of chums
were prisoners in the cabin of their own ship.</p>

<p>Charley leaped from his chair, but he was too
late.</p>

<p>"Outwitted," he cried as he sank back into his
seat. "Beaten at every point of the game. What
fools, what bunglers we are." There was as much
chagrin as fear in his exclamations. To be so badly
beaten after all his vigilance and careful planning
was hard to bear.</p>

<p>His companions sat silent with despair. So suddenly
had it all happened they had not yet had time
to realize that they were completely in the hands of
the Greeks who could do with them as they pleased.</p>

<p>Charley flipped open his pistol and handed one of
his remaining cartridges to his chum, "That gives
us two apiece," he observed, "although I doubt if
we will either of us need them." He retired to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
cabin and reappeared with a blanket and a book.
He spread out the blanket on the floor and stretching
himself out on it prepared to read. "Might
as well get what enjoyment we can," he said.
"There's nothing we can do, so we might as well
take it easy while we may."</p>

<p>"How can you be so careless?" his chum exclaimed,
"any minute they may come down upon
us."</p>

<p>"Little danger of that," the other replied, coolly.
"They know we've got four shots left yet. What
would be the use of their taking chances when they
have got everything in their own hands."</p>

<p>But his companions could not view their position
with the same hopeless resignation. While he read
on apparently unconcerned, they discussed plan after
plan for escape from their prison and perilous situation,
only to reject one after the other as wildly
impracticable. At last they abandoned the discussion
in despair.</p>

<p>"Better turn in and try to get a good night's
rest," Charley advised them calmly. "I will keep
watch for the first four hours, although I don't believe
there's the slightest use of it."</p>

<p>"I'm too hungry to sleep," Walter declared. "I
wonder why they do not send us down our supper."</p>

<p>"Bless your simple little soul," his chum exclaimed,
"They do not intend us to have anything to
eat. I thought you understood that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>His companions looked at each other in dismay.
This, the greatest of all their perils, had not before
occurred to them. They understood now the awfulness
of their position. All the food and water were
stored forward. The Greeks had only to let them
alone and they would slowly die of hunger and
thirst.</p>

<p>"They will not get us that way," declared Walter,
desperately. "Before I'll die of hunger and thirst
I'll set the schooner on fire."</p>

<p>Charley nodded approval. "I've been thinking
of that myself," he said. "A quick death is better
than a slow torturing one. But there is plenty of
time to talk of that. While there is life there is hope
and I have a feeling that something is going to turn
up to help us out of this scrape. I've just happened
to think of one thing that's in our favor."</p>

<p>He was prevented from explaining the new hope
which had occurred to him by a knock on the cabin
door and Manuel's sneering voice enquiring,</p>

<p>"Are the gentlemen quite comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Quite," Charley assured him, calmly. "Much
more comfortable than you and your mates will be
when the law reckons with you."</p>

<p>"There is no law at sea but the law of the strongest
and most cunning," the Greek said, smoothly.
"But I bear a proposal from my shipmates for
your distinguished consideration."</p>

<p>"State it," replied the lad, briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are all in a bad position," stated the Greek
with oily maliciousness. "You were cunning but
not cunning enough or our positions would now be
reversed. We have only to do nothing now and you
will all die. It would sadden our hearts to lose such
loving friends but we would strive to bear up
bravely under the blow. But why should you all die
when we are willing to spare one. All that one
would have to do would be to take an oath to be
faithful and true to us and do as we bid him. Not
only would his life be spared, but he would receive
a share of the great wealth we have discovered."</p>

<p>"Why are you so very generous in your offers?"
Walter demanded, sarcastically.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>IMPRISONED.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">We</span> need one of you," explained Manuel, with
startling frankness. "Perhaps we could get along
without but it does not pay to take chances. There
is a government cutter which patrols the banks to
see that the sponging vessels are complying with the
laws. She may come upon us accidentally any time
and it would be awkward explaining why we continued
to work without American officers. It would
very likely get us into trouble. But if one of you
takes the part of the captain and shows the papers
and explains that the rest have died from fever, all
will go smoothly."</p>

<p>"I suppose you have decided which one of us you
want?" Charley asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"Any one of you will do, but we prefer you.
You have brains enough to realize where your own
interests lie. It is easier to handle a smart man than
a fool. Consider the chance we are giving you, on
the one hand slow, painful, certain death; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
other, an honored position, great wealth and
safety&mdash;we are generous indeed."</p>

<p>"But how do you know that I will play fair?"</p>

<p>"The moment you joined us you would be as
liable to the law as the rest of us," Manuel said
calmly, "We would live or hang together. You
would not dare to trifle with us, and I should watch
you closely all the time."</p>

<p>"Here is my answer," declared Charley, whose
indignation had been steadily rising at the cold-blooded
proposal. "If you would all keep your
part of the agreement,&mdash;which I am convinced you
would not do, I'd die rather than join such a pack of
dirty murderers."</p>

<p>"You are a bigger fool than I thought," replied
the Greek calmly. "I will leave you to consider
the matter better. Hunger is a great persuader, and
I am in hopes that you will soon see where your
best interests lie. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night,
may your dreams be of the pleasantest."</p>

<p>"He's evidently somewhat worried," said
Charley, hopefully, when the Greek's mocking voice
had ceased. "He believes, I guess, that there is a
good chance of the cutter coming upon him or he
would not make such a proposal, although he would
not keep his part of it any longer than the danger
lasted. Our only hope is to keep up our strength and
spirits as long as possible. There is a chance that
the cutter may come along before it is too late. Better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
all turn in and get some rest while you are still
not too hungry to sleep. I will call one of you to
take my place as soon as my four hours are up, although
I do not believe that they will trouble us."</p>

<p>The lad was right in his belief. The night passed
away without any alarm and they were able by turns
to get some little sleep. With the coming of daylight,
they crowded to the windows and searched the
dreary waste of waters for sign of smoke or sail,
but found none. The crew were going about their
work in cheerful unconcern. Leaving a half dozen
men on the schooner, the balance got aboard the
diving boat and sailed out to the sponge ground
where they could be seen working steadily all day
bringing up the gold from the bottom. The prisoners
suffered much during the long day from their
increasing hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>At night the diving boat returned to the schooner
and the dispirited watchers could see that the crew
had not wasted their day by any means. Both
sponge baskets were nearly full of the gold coins.</p>

<p>"We've got to do something, I don't care how
desperate it is," declared Captain Westfield. "Anything
is better than this keeping still and suffering.
By to-morrow this time we'll be too weak to do
much and thar ain't no certainty that the cutter will
come along this way at all. I'm in for doing something,
no matter what."</p>

<p>Charley turned from his gazing out of the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"Look here, Captain," he called, softly.
"Speak low," he cautioned as the old sailor crept
to his side, "we don't want them to hear us on
deck."</p>

<p>"Geewhilikens!" whispered the old seaman in
swift comprehension, "they've left the diving boat
fastened right under our windows."</p>

<p>"God grant that they may not think to move it,"
the lad replied, trembling with excitement. "We
can do nothing until it gets dark and they retire to
the forecastle."</p>

<p>Walter and Chris were quickly made acquainted
with the suddenly-offered chance of escape and their
joy knew no bounds.</p>

<p>Then followed hours which seemed like days to
the breathless, anxious watchers. The Greeks ate
their supper and lounged around the deck talking
and laughing. It seemed as though they would
never retire to their bunks. But at last their voices
gradually ceased and silence settled down upon the
schooner. Charley cautiously opened one of the
big windows and swung it outward, then climbing
softly toward the opening, lowered himself to the
diving boat's deck. The Captain, Walter, and Chris
followed. Not a word was spoken for each realized
the terrible risk they were running. As soon as all
were crouched motionless aboard, Charley, with his
knife, severed the rope which bound them to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
schooner and the boat drifted slowly away from the
ship's side.</p>

<p>No one moved until the schooner was at last lost
in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Start up the engine," said Charley, as he took
the helm, and Walter slipped down amongst the
machinery. After a few minutes' fumbling in the
darkness, he crept back.</p>

<p>"There's no gasoline in the tank," he announced.</p>

<p>"Everything seems against us," Charley sighed.
"Well, get sail on her. We will have to do the
best we can."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the great square sail was spread,
and, leaning over, the little craft sent a line of foam
rippling from her bow.</p>

<p>"They'll have hard work finding us in this darkness,"
exulted the captain as he took the helm from
Charley. "I reckon, we'd better shape a course for
the nearest port,&mdash;that's Judson. As soon as we get
thar, we can telegraph to all the ports along the
coast to watch out for the schooner. We've got
'em now, I reckon, lads, they'll have to put in somewhere
sooner or later, an' they'll be nabbed. I feel
just like yelling for joy."</p>

<p>The rising spirits of the little party were helped
by Chris' discovery of a couple of loaves of stale
black bread, and part of a bottle of ripe olives in
one of the lockers. They made a meagre but very
welcome repast upon the uninviting food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>But their joy over their lucky escape was soon
dampened by the threatening appearance of the
Western sky. A heavy bank of clouds was slowly
rising there from which came flashes of lightning
and the rumble of distant thunder.</p>

<p>"I reckon, it ain't nothin' but a thunder squall,"
the captain assured them. "Thar ain't no call to be
uneasy, this is a mighty seaworthy little craft. I
reckon, we could ride out a right smart gale in her
if we had it to do."</p>

<p>Before they ran much further the captain gave
the order to lower and reef the great sail. When
hoisted again, it was only a tiny patch of canvas, as
compared with its former size.</p>

<p>"Thar's only one thing for us to do when that
squall strikes us an' that's to scud before it," the old
captain declared. "We can't heave her to under
that sail. Luckily, the way it's coming won't blow
us out of our course much."</p>

<p>They had not long to wait for the storm to burst.
The wind soon descended with a violence that
threatened to bury the diving boat in the seas it
brought with it. But the little craft had been built
to stand just such weather, and, quickly gathering
headway, she darted away before the gale. With
the wind came the rain in great driving, blinding
sheets. The boys hailed its appearance with joy.
They spread out their jackets, bits of sail, and even
their hats to catch the precious drops. In a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
while they had secured enough to quench their intense
thirst. This done, they gathered around the
captain at the helm ready to render any assistance
in their power. There was little they could do for
the old sailor would trust no one but himself to
steer in the heavy sea-way. As the hours passed by
without showing any abatement of the storm, it became
evident to his companions that he was growing
anxious.</p>

<p>"I don't like the way it's hanging on," he declared.
"We must be making at least twelve miles
an hour and, at that rate, we will have the land close
aboard before daylight. Crawl forward, Charley,
an' keep a sharp look-out, the sky is clearing some
an', I reckon, you can see a few hundred feet
ahead."</p>

<p>The lad obediently worked his way up into the
bow, and bracing himself against the anchor bitts,
peered ahead into the darkness. He could make out
nothing at first but the heavy foam-flecked, tossing
water. He sat watching intently till, at last, Walter
crawled forward to take his place. He had only
got part way back to the stern when there came a
cry from his chum,</p>

<p>"Hard down! hard down!"</p>

<p>With true seaman's quickness, the Captain
jammed the long tiller over and the little craft, escaping
broaching in the trough of the seas by a
miracle, shot up into the wind&mdash;a second too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang on for your lives!" the old sailor cried.</p>

<p>Black masses loomed out of the darkness to leeward.
A great wave picked up the helpless boat and
flung it with crashing, breaking timbers, upon the
rocks.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>WRECKED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys had obeyed the old sailor's order, and,
though greatly shaken by the shock, they retained
their hold on the boat.</p>

<p>"Quick, get on the rocks," shouted the Captain.
"She'll pound to pieces in a jiffy."</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boat's bow had been driven up
on the ledge nearly out of the water. The boys
dropped over the side followed by the old sailor,
and, though beaten and bruised against the sharp
rocks succeeded in struggling out upon the one
which reared itself above the water. They glanced
back to where the boat had struck, but, short as had
been their struggle out, it had witnessed the destruction
of the staunch craft. Only that portion of her
bow lodged upon the reef remained intact, the balance
of her hull was a mass of twisted, splintered,
broken planks.</p>

<p>Great as was the danger from which they had
escaped, their present position was still far from
safe. The slippery rock afforded but insecure footing
and it was frequently swept by the larger seas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
At such times, they had all they could do to keep
from being swept off its slimy surface.</p>

<p>"I reckon, we've struck on a reef," the Captain
said, anxiously. "It all depends upon the tide
whether we are safe or not. If it's low tide, now,
high tide will cover this rock so deep that we'll not
be able to hang on to it."</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the tide was still rising,
though slowly. The waves began sweeping
over the flat rock with such violence that the tired,
wretched, anxious, little party could hardly maintain
their footing. To the right and left of them,
rose other higher masses of rock, but they did not
dare to attempt to reach them through the darkness
and the boiling surf. Wet, cold, hungry, and
wretched; they clung to their insecure refuge until
day began to break in the East. With the coming
of light they strained their brine-smarting eyes to
discover what manner of place it was upon which
they had been thrown. The outlook was not reassuring.
They were, as the Captain had surmised,
on a point of low-lying reef, most of which was constantly
wave-swept by the monstrous surges. To
the East of them, lay a low, marshy shore dotted
here and there with small islands covered with
cedar hammocks, but between them and the islands
was at least two miles of foaming water. The boys
gazed wistfully at the longed-for land.</p>

<p>"We can't make it," Charley said, sadly. "Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
might, perhaps, be able to swim it, but it would be
a long swim for the rest of us at any time, and, tired
and weak as we are now, it would be impossible.
We will have to stick it out here until the storm goes
down a bit, then, try to fashion some kind of a raft
out of the planks of the diving boat."</p>

<p>"We can't be far from Judson," said the Captain,
with an attempt at cheerfulness. "A boat may
come by an' pick us up any minute."</p>

<p>But the boys were not cheered by any such prospect.
They knew that the chance of any boat being
out in such weather was very small indeed. One
fact, however, gave them a little hope; the tide was
undoubtedly falling. It had evidently been almost
at its height when they had landed on the rock.</p>

<p>"I wish we had something to eat," Walter sighed,
"we have had nothing but a little bread in two
days. I begin to feel weak all over."</p>

<p>Chris gazed thoughtfully at the water on the
shore-side of the rock. "I reckon, I might find
somethin' down dar," he observed. "I'se goin' to
try it anyway. You white chilluns has sho' got to
hab somethin' to eat."</p>

<p>Although the water was somewhat smoother to
the lee of the rocks, it boiled and foamed there
threateningly and the boys endeavored to dissuade
the plucky little negro from the attempt, but their
objections only made him the more determined.</p>

<p>"Golly! you chilluns doan know what a diver dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
nigger is," he said, proudly. "You jes' stay still an'
watch him now." He removed his clothes, handing
them to Charley to hold, slipped over the side of the
rock, and sank down beneath the surface. He was
gone so long that the watchers had begun to grow
anxious when he reappeared, blowing like a porpoise.
In one hand, he held tightly clenched, a big
stone crab and a large conch.</p>

<p>"Take 'em," he exclaimed, "I'se goin' down
again. Dar's heaps more of dem on de bottom."</p>

<p>He continued diving until he had brought up six
more conchs and two more crabs, then he crawled
out on the rock completely exhausted, and held up
one foot for their inspection. There was a tiny
puncture in the sole of it from which the blood was
slowly trickling.</p>

<p>"I reckon, I'se goin' to hab some trubble wid dat
foot," he observed, gravely. "Ole Mister Stingaree
gib me a dig dar. He warn't much bigger dan
a plate, but der horns are powerful poison."</p>

<p>His announcement sent a chill of fear to the
hearts of his companions, for they all well-knew the
dangerous character of the flat, horn-tailed fish
which lurks on the bottom in Florida waters. The
Captain did not lose a second in whipping out his
sheath knife and cutting open the puncture which he
washed out thoroughly with sea water. He then
made Chris sit on the edge of the rock and hang his
foot over in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The plucky little negro bore the operation with
unflinching cheerfulness. "I sho' wish you'd open
up one ob dem conch for me, Massa Charley," he observed.
"If dis ting's goin' to make me sick, I
wants to be dat much ahead."</p>

<p>Charley quickly broke open one of the conchs
and gave him the meat,&mdash;a big lump of tough flesh,
almost sufficient for an entire meal. He also opened
several others for the Captain, Walter, and himself,
upon which they made a hearty and strengthening,
if somewhat tasteless, meal. Chris ate but little of
the tough meat, he soon pushed it away from him
with a weary little sigh.</p>

<p>"I doan want no moah," he said, quietly. "I'ze
gettin' berry sick. Reckon ole Mister Stingaree
dun got dis nigger for sho'."</p>

<p>His little ebony face soon took on a dull-ashen
hue and he began to vomit violently; passing from
these spells into a heavy stupor, the mysterious subtle
poison from the stingaree was getting in its
work. His grieving companions watched him in
helpless suspense, there was nothing they could do
to relieve his sufferings.</p>

<p>"We can't let him die like this," Charley cried, as
the little sufferer twitched in spasms of pain. "I
am going to try to reach shore and find help. He
has taken bigger risks for us many a time."</p>

<p>Neither Walter or the Captain tried to stop him.
They would have gladly offered to make the attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in his place but he was the strongest and best swimmer
of the three.</p>

<p>He removed his jacket and shoes and with a last
good-bye, plunged off of the rock and headed for the
distant shore. He had not gone more than twenty
yards when he stopped with a cry of joy.</p>

<p>"Come on," he called back, "the water isn't more
than three feet deep here. There's only a deep place
near the rocks and you can get across that easily."</p>

<p>But he had to return to help them get Chris across
the deep narrow channel, for the little negro's struggles
in his spasms threatened to drown his helpers.
At last, the dangerous stretch of water was safely
crossed, and, leaving Walter and the Captain to half
float and half carry Chris between them, the lad
waded ahead, picking out the shoalest and smoothest
path to the shore. They arrived there spent and
panting and sank down for a moment to recover
their breath. It was not an inviting-looking place
where they had landed. A low rock-strewn marsh,
covered with tall, rank grass stretched away before
them for two or three miles before it met the higher,
heavily-wooded mainland. Here and there the
marsh was dotted with small, island-like clumps of
dark green cedar trees, and, picking up the light,
little negro in his strong, young arms, Charley
headed for the nearest of these, followed by his exhausted
companions. The passage was made with
difficulty; low needle-pointed rocks strewed the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and here and there lay pools of soft, boggy mud,
tenanted by repulsive, swollen looking moccasins.
It needed care to avoid the one without stepping on
the other, but, at last, the patch of high ground was
reached and, laying his burden beneath a wide-spreading
cedar, Charley turned to his companions.</p>

<p>"We have got to work quick if we are to stand a
chance even of saving him," he said, crisply. "Walter,
get in to the mainland as quick as you can and
bring me all the palmetto berries you can find,&mdash;hurry.
Captain, let me take your flint and steel and
then get me a lot of soft mud from the marsh."</p>

<p>Tired though they were, the two hastened away to
execute his orders, while Charley worked swiftly to
carry out the plan he had formed while coming
ashore. It was a heroic one, but rough measures
were the only ones it was in his power to apply.
Hastily gathering together a pile of dead cedar
limbs, he lit a fire with the flint and steel. While it
was blazing up, he stripped off his belt and, tying it
above Chris' knee, with a stick twisted it tight until
it was embedded in the flesh, shutting off the flow of
blood from below to the heart. He next heated a
small stone in the now blazing fire and applied it
while hot to the swollen wound. The smell of the
crisping flesh sickened him, but he doggedly stuck to
his task until he judged the wound was sufficiently
cauterized. Chris lay mercifully lost to the pain in
a deep stupor. The lad had just finished burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the wound when the Captain returned with his
jacket full of soft mud, and, emptying it out,
hastened back for another load. Charley heaped a
lot of rocks upon the fire, and, as soon as they were
hot, ranged them close on each side of the wounded
limb, heaping the soft mud on top of them until he
had formed an air-tight mound over the leg. He
now had a great poultice of hot mud of great drawing
power, the danger was that Chris might be attacked
by other spasms and succeed in working his
leg out from the hot covering. To prevent this, the
lad tore his shirt up into strips and, binding the little
negro tightly, piled stones around the encased leg
so that it could not be easily moved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>HUNTING HELP.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span> next cut off small branches of cedar
and placed them under the unconscious little fellow's
head and back so that he might rest as comfortably
as possible. This done, he sat back breathless and
exhausted and waited impatiently for Walter's return.</p>

<p>Captain Westfield surveyed the young physician's
work with hopeful admiration. "If Chris lives, it
will be you as has saved his life," he declared.</p>

<p>"He has saved mine more than once," Charley
replied, "but I am afraid he is not going to live. I
don't like this deep stupor he has fallen into. I
wish Walter would hurry."</p>

<p>Walter had been hurrying as fast as he could, and
he soon appeared bearing a hatful of ripe palmetto
berries. His riddled shoes and bleeding feet told of
reckless running over the sharp rocks.</p>

<p>Charley smashed the ripe berries between two
stones, catching the juice in his cap. Chris' teeth
were tightly set, but he managed to pry them apart
with his knife blade and forced some of the sticky
liquid down his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know whether it will help him or not,
but I am in hopes it will," he said, as, tired out, he
sat down by the little fellow's side. "Those berries
make a powerful tonic and stimulant, and I believe
that is what is needed. The poison seems to have
deadened the heart's action and brought on that
stupor. A few minutes will tell whether it is going
to do any good."</p>

<p>It soon became evident that the rude remedies
were performing their mission well, the sufferer's
pulse, which had grown slow and feeble, quickened,
and his little face began to lose some of its
ashen hue.</p>

<p>As soon as he became sure that a change for the
better was taking place, Charley arose from his
brief rest.</p>

<p>"I am going to find help," he declared. "We
must get him to some place where he can have
proper attention. How far do you think we are
from Judson, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Not more than twenty miles to the north of it,
I judge. Maybe not more than ten miles. But you
must not dream of starting yet awhile, lad. You
must rest for a bit, an' have something to eat first."</p>

<p>"And I am going with you when you start,"
Walter declared. "Something might happen to you
amongst those slippery rocks and awful bog holes.
The Captain can do all that can be done for Chris
while you are gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no disputing the wisdom of both suggestions
and they busied themselves with the first
proposition, the finding of something to eat. This
demanded more time and trouble. Another trip had
to be made down to the water and considerable
searching was necessary before they could collect
enough of crabs and shell fish to make the full meal
that their hunger craved. Their rest they gained
while their dinner was roasting in the coals.</p>

<p>Their rest, meal, and Chris' steadily improving
condition, put them all in better strength and spirits,
and the boys were cheerful when they bid the old
sailor good-bye and made their start in search of
help.</p>

<p>"We'll be back as soon as we can get back, Captain,"
Charley said, "but you don't want to worry
if we take longer than you expect."</p>

<p>"I reckon, I'll keep too busy to have much time
for worryin'," the old sailor replied. "Jes' be careful,
lads, an' get back as soon as you can."</p>

<p>He watched until the rank marsh grass hid the
two lads from sight, then busied himself with making
the camp a little more comfortable for himself
and his sick companion. Chris' welfare was the
first thing to claim his attention. With his sheath
knife he cut armful after armful of marsh grass and
added it to the rough couch Charley had fashioned
for the little negro, converting it into a soft, comfortable
bed. The low-hanging cedar boughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
formed a kind of rude shelter over the little lad, but
the captain was not entirely satisfied with it. The
rainy season was near at hand and heavy showers
might be expected at any time. A thick layer of
marsh grass placed over the lowest cedar limbs
quickly made the covering more to his satisfaction.
This done, he paused for a brief rest and to decide
what should be his next task. Although, he knew
that the port of Judson could not be more than
twenty miles away, he realized that, owing to the
necessarily slow traveling amongst the sharp rocks
and bog holes, it might be at least three days before
the boys could succeed in getting back with help.
His duties, then, would be the care of Chris, the providing
of food for them both, and the gathering of
firewood. Water was luckily plentiful, there was an
abundance of it in a cup-like depression near the
center of the island.</p>

<p>In a Northern country with no weapons but his
sheath knife, these tasks would have seemed almost
impossible of accomplishment, but the captain was
not discouraged. The first thing, of course, was to
see that the little negro's marked improvement was
not checked. Heating more stones in the fire, the
old sailor piled them around the mound of mud covering
the wounded leg. Then, as the berries Walter
had brought were nearly exhausted, he decided that
the next thing of importance was to lay in a fresh
supply. He found the trip to the mainland slow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
dangerous. Where the way was not strewn with
sharp-pointed rocks, it was dotted with forbidding-looking
sink holes of soft, slimy mud. Rank-growing
marsh grass covered the whole, making it extremely
difficult to pick out a safe passage through
the dangers. At last, however, he gained the mainland
where he found the oily black berries growing
in greatest profusion. He gathered his jacket full
of them and then sat down on a fallen log to rest a
minute and look around. It was an inviting spot in
which he found himself. The land rose up from the
marsh to form a high, sloping bluff through which
trickled a stream of clear, reddish water.</p>

<p>The bluff was covered with a dense growth of
palms, satinwoods, bays, rubber trees, and low-ground
palmettos. It was an ideal place for a
camp, and the captain eyed it regretfully, wishing
that it was possible to bring Chris there from the
little marsh-surrounded island. But that was impossible
until the little fellow was able to walk and
he dismissed the idea with a sigh. He was just
gathering up his jacket of berries to leave when a
noise in the undergrowth close at hand made him
sink back to his seat on the log. The brushes before
him parted suddenly and a large deer stepped
out into an open place not twenty feet from where
he sat. For a full two minutes, he and the timid
animal remained motionless, looking directly into
each other's eyes, then the old sailor pulled out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sheath knife and sprang for it with some wild notion
of securing it for food, but the deer leaped lightly
away a few steps and stopped again as if in deepest
wonder and curiosity. The captain sheathed his
knife with a sigh. "I reckon, you don't know how
wicked men are," he addressed the graceful animal.
"Guess you ain't ever seed many men or you
wouldn't be so powerful tame. Some steaks from
you would taste right good, but you ain't aiming to
let me get close enough for that. Well, good-bye,
old fellow, I hope I'll meet you again sometime
when I've got a good gun."</p>

<p>Saying which, the old sailor picked up his burden
and headed back for the island, the deer gazing after
him in innocent-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>He had nearly reached the little camp when a
scream from Chris sent him forward at a run, regardless
of rocks and sink holes.</p>

<p>The scene that met his gaze as he burst into the
little clearing chilled him with horror and dismay.</p>

<p>Attracted, no doubt, by its warmth, two huge,
swollen-looking moccasins had crawled up on the
little heap of mud and now lay with their flat, ugly
heads within a few inches of the little negro's trembling
body.</p>

<p>"Don't move an inch, Chris," he shouted, as he
broke off a dead limb from a cedar tree.</p>

<p>The caution was useless, for, bound as he was,
hand and foot, Chris could only lay and stare in
horror and helplessness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>A couple of well-aimed blows from the stick
killed the two poisonous, sluggish serpents, and,
dragging them to the edge of the island, the captain
pitched them out into the marsh.</p>

<p>"They ain't very pleasant visitors," he remarked
as he returned to his helpless companion, "but I
reckon, they've done you a heap of good. You was
laying like a dead man when I went ashore and now
you look right pert and lively."</p>

<p>"Dey's too sudden an' powerful medicine,"
grumbled Chris. "Dis nigger might jes' as well
die as be scart to death. Golly! how my leg does
burn and smart. Please take dat stuff off ob hit,
Massa Captain, an' unloose my han's."</p>

<p>But the old sailor feared to remove the mud poultice,
dreading another relapse. However, he untied
the little negro's hands, upon his promise that he
would lie still and not move. He was delighted
with the change in the little lad. Whether the shock
from the snakes, or, what was much more probable,
the continued effects of the palmetto juice had done
the work, the stupor which had frightened them all
was entirely gone, and the patient soon declared
himself decidedly hungry.</p>

<p>Cutting a stick and laying it within Chris' reach
so that he would have the means of protecting himself
from other possible visitors, the Captain departed
in search of food.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>THE CASTAWAYS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was lucky for the captain that he was wise to
the resources of the Florida coast. A stranger to
the country would not have known where to look
for food and would likely have soon perished of
hunger. Although he had no other weapon than
his sheath knife, he went about his task with the
air of a man who was confident of success. Before
leaving the island, he cut a long, straight cypress
pole and sharpened one end to a keen point. With
this in his hand, he made his way down to the Gulf.
The tide was high again but there was a mass of
rock some two hundred feet from shore which protruded
a couple of feet above the water. Removing
his shoes, he waded cautiously out, prodding
the bottom before him with his pole and picking
his way carefully to avoid stepping on a stingaree.</p>

<p>The rock reached, he perched himself on its edge
and sat peeping down into the water which was
clear as crystal. He had not long to wait. In a few
minutes a fish swam slowly past close to the rock,
and, taking careful aim, the old sailor dove his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
rude spear down with all his force. Its point struck
just behind the fish's head, passing entirely through
its body. It died without a struggle, and the captain
lifted it out upon the rock with a shout of triumph.
It was a beautifully-specked sea trout about
three feet in length and weighed at least twelve
pounds. Although there was plenty of other fish
within sight, the trout was enough for their present
needs and, scaling and washing it carefully, the captain
waded ashore with his prize. But he was not
yet quite satisfied. Laying his fish down upon a
bunch of clean sea moss, he examined carefully the
muddy beach near the water's edge. Here and
there, tiny jets of water squirted up from the mud,
and, where they seemed to be most numerous, he
began to dig. In a few minutes he had unearthed a
couple of dozen large clams. With these and the
fish, and a huge armful of moist sea moss in his
arms, he made his way back to camp where Chris
was eagerly awaiting his return.</p>

<p>"I sho' wish I could get up from hyah," mourned
the little negro. "Golly! I reckon, I'd show you
how to cook dat fish so dat you nebber could eat
nuff ob hit."</p>

<p>"You jes' lie still thar," commanded the captain.
"I'm a Cape Cod man, an' thar ain't any
cook living that can show a Cape Cod man how to
cook this kind of grub. You just watch and learn
somethin'."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Chris watched him with professional jealousy
and interest. He firmly believed that no one on
earth could cook as good as he but he reluctantly
admitted to himself that the old sailor made his
preparations with considerable promise of success.</p>

<p>First, he scooped out a hole in the ground about
three feet deep and two feet square and kindled a
small fire in the bottom upon which he placed a
layer of small rocks, as soon as it was going good,
then, he paused to remark regretfully,</p>

<p>"I wish we had some potatoes. I never heard of
a clam bake yet without potatoes."</p>

<p>"Dar's something jes' as good as 'taters," declared
Chris, pointing to a low-growing plant.
"Jes' you dig up some ob dem roots an' try 'em.
Hit's wild cassava, an' hit taste jes' like Irish
'taters."</p>

<p>The captain dug down with his sheath knife and
unearthed several tubers a couple of feet in length
and about three inches in circumference. He regarded
them dubiously, but, on Chris' repeated
assurances that they were good and wholesome, he
cut off several pieces and washed them carefully.
By the time this was done, the fire in the pit had
burned low, and the stones were smoking hot. Cutting
several broad, green, palmetto leaves, he laid
them on the stones and spread over them a thin
layer of the moist sea moss. Upon the moss he laid
the fish and over it spread another layer of moss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
upon which he placed the clams, covering them with
more moss, upon which he placed the cassava, and,
piling a thick layer of sea grass over the whole,
built a small fire on top of it. Then he sat down
and watched the fire while he and Chris waited
hungrily the slow cooking of their meal. At last,
the captain declared that it must be done. The fire
on top was raked away, the contents of the pit were
taken out and placed upon green, clean palmetto
leaves, and the two castaways fell-to with appetites
sharpened by their long wait. And what a feast it
was,&mdash;the clams cooked to perfection in their own
juice, the fish juicy and delicious, the cassava snow-white
and mealy and all rendered doubly delicious
by the salt spicy taste of the seaweed in which they
had been cooked. And what a joy it was to feel
that the worst of their troubles were over. Chris
getting better, the boys soon to be back with help,
all the worry and anxiety they had suffered past,
the next few days to see them all safely back in
Tarpon, where they would all wait in comfort and
safety, ready to claim their ship when the Greeks
brought her in, and, after that, they would return
for the gold and with it they would secure the
many things they had longed for all their lives.</p>

<p>Surely the prospect was bright enough to make
the two lonely castaways chatter brightly, cheerfully,
and hopefully over their evening meal. They
could not see the dangers, worries, and misfortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
yet to befall them, and it was well they could not for
it would have robbed the two of the happiest hour
they had had in many days.</p>

<p>At last, the feast was over and Chris had paid
the cook the highest compliment of which he could
conceive.</p>

<p>"Golly! Massa Capt., you cooked dem tings
might nigh as good as I could have done."</p>

<p>Although there were many things which the
captain wished to do, darkness was fast coming
on and he had to complete his final preparations for
the night. First, he cut a lot of small boughs which
he piled up under the shelter close to Chris to serve
as his own bed. This done, he gathered piles of
wood which he spread in a circle around the big
cedar and set on fire to protect them both from
chance visits of snakes during the night. By the
time this was finished, it was dark and he crept in
under the shelter close to his dusky little companion
in misfortune, and, after a short, simple prayer
full of thankfulness for their deliverance from the
dangers that had threatened them, he quickly fell
into the deep sleep of total exhaustion. But sleep
did not come so readily to Chris. He had slept, or
been unconscious, much of the time since his accident
and the stimulating effect of the palmetto
medicine helped to drive slumber away from him.
He lay very quiet to avoid disturbing the old sailor's
rest, but, try as he would, he could not get to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sleep. At last he gave up the attempt and lay with
eyes wide open looking out at the stars and the
twinkling camp-fires. From the marsh about came
strange noises of the night, the croaking of multitudes
of frogs, the cackle of marsh hens, the squawking
of cranes, and the rustling of the marsh grass
in the wind. Slowly the circle of fire died down,
smouldered and went out. Only the big main camp-fire
was left a glowing mass of embers.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wakeful little negro's ears caught
another sound mingled with the voices of the
night,&mdash;a slow, heavy, creeping noise. For a time
he lay quiet listening, his hearing strained to the
utmost to catch the new strange sound. He waited
until there was no doubt that it was close at hand
and steadily drawing nearer, then, he reached
over and shook his snoring companion.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Massa Captain," he cried, "dar's
some wild beast a creepin' into de camp."</p>

<p>"I hear it," agreed the captain, instantly wide
awake. "Jes' lay still, lad, an' don't be frightened.
I'll stir up the fire a bit, that will run it off."</p>

<p>He arose from his couch and strode boldly for
the smouldering fire.</p>

<p>"Look out!" Chris yelled, suddenly, "Foah de
Lawd's sake, look out!" His keen eyes had caught
a glimpse of a black shape passing between the old
sailor and the mass of glowing embers, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
warning came too late,&mdash;the captain was upon the
moving shape before he saw it.</p>

<p>A swishing noise rent the air, a loud thud, the
old sailor was knocked backward several feet flat
on the ground, and, with a loud, sharp bellowing,
the mysterious visitor glided away into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Is you hurt? Is you hurt, Massa Cap?" cried
the terror-stricken lad.</p>

<p>"A little bit, a little bit," called back the old
sailor, his voice hoarse with pain.</p>

<p>He came creeping back into the shelter on hands
and knees.</p>

<p>"It was a big bull alligator," he explained, painfully.
"Must have been twelve feet long. It
caught me a fearful blow on the legs with its tail.
I hope thar ain't no bones broken but it feels as
though thar was."</p>

<p>A close examination proved his fears groundless,
but the terrible blow had done all but break the
bones. In spite of the pain, however, he crawled
forth again and replenished the fire, but he was
faint and giddy with pain before he succeeded in
getting back into the shelter and stretched out on
his couch once more.</p>

<p>"I reckon, I'll be all right by morning," he said,
hopefully, "but I don't calculate I'll be able to
sleep any more to-night, my legs hurt too bad for
that. Don't make any difference though, I 'low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
I've had enough sleep for one night&mdash;it can't be
more than a couple of hours 'till daylight."</p>

<p>It proved to be even less and with the coming of
light he removed his trousers and examined his
limbs anxiously. He had indeed received a terrible
blow from the prowling monster, both legs were
bruised and swollen where the tail had struck it and
it seemed a miracle that the bones had not been
broken. It caused him exquisite pain to rise upon
his feet, but there was work which had to be done,
and, in spite of his suffering, he must do it. So,
hiding his pain as well as he could, he prepared to
sally forth to secure food for the day.</p>

<p>But in spite of all his efforts he could not entirely
hide his intense suffering.</p>

<p>"You jes' lay down an' let me go out an' find
grub, Massa Cap," Chris pleaded. "I feels jes' as
well as can be again now."</p>

<p>But the sturdy old sailor would not listen to his
pleadings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>ANOTHER DANGER.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Dar's</span> one thing I want you to do 'fore you go
projectin' off," said the little negro. "I wants you
to cut me some ob dem palmetto buds. I'se goin' to
braid you a hat. Hit's a plum wonder dat you ain't
got sun struck goin' bareheaded like you is."</p>

<p>"I ain't had time to remember that I lost my hat
when we were wrecked. I'se been so worried an'
busy," said the captain. "Now you speak of it,
my head does feel sort of dull an' heavy. I hope
the boys will think to cover their heads with something&mdash;this
sun does beat down right hot."</p>

<p>"Mass Charley will sho' rig up some kind ob
hat," Chris declared, confidently. "'Sides dey's
both young an' can stand a heap more sun den
what you kin. You jes' be mighty careful dis
mornin' an' by noon dis nigger will hab a fine hat
fixed for you. I'se done made lots ob dem on Cat
Island."</p>

<p>There was a few young cabbage palms scattered
over the island and the captain cut out several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the buds with his sheath knife and placed them beside
the little negro, then, knotting up the ends of
his bandanna handkerchief to form a turban, he
took his spear and started for the shore.</p>

<p>Chris watched his slow, faltering, painful steps
until he was out of sight then began on his proposed
task. The buds were really young fresh
leaves yet unfolded, soft and pliable, yet very
strong. He shredded them into strips about half
an inch in width until he had accumulated quite a
pile; then, taking four of the pieces at a time, with
deft, skillful fingers, he wove them into a braid
about an inch in width.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours, he had a string of braid
several yards long.</p>

<p>The fashioning of the braid into a hat, without
needle and thread and while lying flat on his back
was a more difficult task, but he attacked it with
cheerful energy, using the point of his knife for a
needle and small strips of palmetto for thread. At
last, his task was completed, and, although the hat
was grotesque in shape and appearance, it was soft,
strong, and light, and would prove an effective protection
from the fierce rays of the tropic sun. The
little worker was not yet satisfied but at once set
about the manufacture of a basket from the same
material realizing how useful it would be for the
carrying of clams, fish, and other things.</p>

<p>He was still engaged upon it when the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
came stumbling into camp bearing a large fish and
several dozen more of the clams. The old sailor's
face was red, his movement weak and uncertain,
and his breathing heavy and labored, while he was
trembling violently from head to foot. He sank
down in the cedar's shade and wiped his flaming
face.</p>

<p>"I reckon, I've got a touch of the sun," he said,
feebly. "I feel weak and dizzy. I'll lie down in
the shade for a bit an' it will pass off. Don't be
worried, lad, it will pass off in a jiffy."</p>

<p>But pass off it did not. By the end of half an
hour the sturdy old seaman was lying unconscious,
his breath coming in short, wheezy gasps.</p>

<p>Chris watched him for a while in anxiety and
fear. He knew that it might be dangerous for him
to move his wounded leg but all thought of his own
danger was lost in the fear that the stricken old
sailor was dying before his eyes. He attempted to
pull his leg out from the mound but could not move
it. The heat of the stones had baked the mud hard.
With great effort he raised himself into a sitting position,
and, with his sheath knife cut and dug away
frantically at the baked mud until he had the leg
uncovered, then, severing the bandage above his
knee, he attempted to rise but could not move the
injured limb. He fell back and viewed it with
frightened dismay. It was not a pretty sight for it
was a mass of blisters where the hot mud had clung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and a large bluish swelling marked the place where
the stingaree's horn had entered. The tight
bandage, shutting off the blood supply for so long,
had rendered it paralyzed and useless. Although
the breaking blisters caused him exquisite pain, he
fell to rubbing the numbed limb briskly with both
hands until the blood crept slowly back into the
veins. At last, he was able to gain his feet and by
resting most of his weight on his uninjured leg
managed to limp over to the unconscious sailor.
Luckily, he had been raised in a torrid country
where sunstrokes were of frequent occurrence. He
knew just what to do and he did it quickly and
surely. His first act was to raise the unconscious
man's head and place a high pillow of twigs
beneath it. Then, stirring the smouldering fire, he
placed several large stones in the glowing coals.
While they were heating he removed the captain's
shoes and bathed his hot head and flushed face with
cool water, and tearing his shirt to pieces, wet it and
bound it around the sufferer's head. By the time
this was done, the stones were hot, and, rolling a
couple up in his jacket, he placed them at the captain's
feet, then, seated by his side, he awaited the
result with fear and trembling. A terrible dread
gripped his heart that the remedies had been applied
too late, for the old sailor had all the appearance of
a dying man. Thirty minutes dragged slowly away
without apparent change, then, slowly, the old sailor's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
breathing grew less labored and his face began
to lose some of its fiery hue. Chris hailed these
favorable signs with joy as indicated that the crisis
had been safely passed, but his joy was somewhat
dampened when the hours passed by without the
stricken man showing signs of consciousness. He
seemed to pass from his stupor to a deep sleep from
which the little negro dreaded awakening him. It
was evident that the old seaman was in for a long
spell of weakness from the heat stroke he had suffered.
There was nothing more his little companion
could do to relieve his sufferings and he
remained seated by his side watching him anxiously
until the waning of the afternoon warned him that
it was time to partake of food and make preparations
for the night. He had eaten nothing since the
night before and he was conscious of a sense of
growing weakness. The fish the captain had caught
was already tainted from the heat and the little
negro felt too weak as yet to venture forth to
secure more, so he dug up a few of the cassava roots
which he roasted in the coals. These, together with
a handful of palmetto berries, constituted his supper.
As soon as it was finished he began his preparations
for the night. Slowly and painfully, he
gathered together broken limbs to keep the circles
of fire going until daylight came again. By the
time this was accomplished and the fires lit he was
weak and trembling from pain and exhaustion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was glad to crawl onto his couch by the captain's
side. The old sailor roused into momentary wakefulness
at the noise of the snapping twigs.</p>

<p>"How you is, Massa Capt.?" demanded the little
negro, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Weak, mighty weak. Feel as though I couldn't
lift my hand to my head, but I will be all right by
morning, I reckon. I guess, we have got no cause
to worry now. The boys will be back to-night or
early in the morning at the latest. How do you feel,
lad?"</p>

<p>"Fine," lied the little negro, cheerfully. "Jes'
you go back to sleep again. I'll keep de fires up all
right."</p>

<p>With a sigh of satisfaction, the captain closed his
eyes and was soon sound asleep again, but there was
no such rest for his little companion. Twice Chris
hobbled out and renewed the fires. The third time
he had to crawl forth on hands and knees. His
wound was again swelling rapidly and he could no
longer bear his weight on the injured limb. He
tried vainly to sleep. The wounded leg throbbed
with intense pain which gradually crept over his
whole body, making him feel sick and faint all over.
He understood the reason for his sufferings. Some
of the poison still left in his wound had, with the
removal of the tight bandages from his leg, found
its way back into the blood and was coursing
through his little body poisoning as it went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Golly!" he remarked, grimly, to himself, "if
dem white chillens doan get back wid help an'
medicine by mornin', I reckon dis nigger ain't agoin'
to see Cat Island and his old mammy no moah.
An' if Chris gits plum helpless what's goin' to become
ob Massa Captain wid no one to tend to him.
He tinks he'll be all right in de mornin' but hits
goin' to take a powerful long time for him to get
real peart again."</p>

<p>The long night dragged slowly away. Occasionally
the little negro crept forth and replenished
the fires, the balance of the time he lay quiet listening
for cry or sound that would tell of the boys'
return, but nothing fell upon his strained hearing
but the croak of frogs, the bellowing of alligators
and the strange night noises of the marsh.</p>

<p>At daylight the captain awoke and attempted to
rise, but, although he was greatly improved, he was
yet too weak to stand erect.</p>

<p>"You jes' lie still," Chris counseled him, "dar
ain't no call for you to go projectin' around none.
I'se goin' out an' git somethin' for us to eat."</p>

<p>Although it cost him intense pain, the little negro
managed to walk erect until he was out of the old
sailor's sight, then he dropped down on hands and
knees and crawled painfully down to the shore.</p>

<p>The touch of the cool salt water helped the
throbbing pain in his leg and he succeeded in wading
out to the rocks where he was not long in spearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
a large, fat mackerel. With this, he returned
to the camp, for he did not dare in his growing
weakness to search for clams or other food. He
found the old sailor asleep again, and, cleaning the
fish he broiled it over the coals. As soon as it was
done he awakened the sleeper.</p>

<p>"Hyah is youah breakfas' all nice an' hot," he
announced. "You want to eat a plenty ob hit.
I'se agoin' to lay down a spell. I didn't sleep berry
good last night."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>THE RELAPSE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Captain Westfield</span> ate heartily of the delicious
fish. Much to his delight, he found that, except for
the extreme weakness following his heat prostration,
he felt unusually well. He wisely decided not
to invite a relapse by getting up at once, and, as
soon as he had finished eating, he lay back upon
his couch and quietly fell asleep again. It was
midday when he awoke feeling much better and
stronger. The first thing that met his gaze as he
gained a sitting position was Chris lying in the
same position in which he had first flung himself.
He called to him several times but the little negro
lay still and motionless. Thoroughly alarmed, he
crawled over and surveyed the unconscious lad.
The sight of the enormously swollen leg and a few
minutes' fingering of the dark little wrist told him
what was the matter. The slow pulse beats showed
that the subtile poison, released from its confinement
by the removal of the bandage, had found its way
to the plucky, loyal, little heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain sat down by the little fellow's side
and dashed the stinging tears from his eyes.</p>

<p>"He's killed himself for me," he moaned. "If
he had laid still just as he was he would have been
all right. But, God bless him, he risked his life for
a poor, old, worthless hulk like me. An' thar ain't
nothing I can do to save him now."</p>

<p>Although he had but small faith that it would do
any good in such a desperate case, he hastily crushed
out a cupful of juice from the palmetto berries and
forced it down Chris' throat, then, resuming his seat
by his side, he watched to see if the powerful
stimulant would have any effect.</p>

<p>As the hours dragged slowly away he rejoiced
to see that the lad's condition apparently grew no
worse. Encouraged, he crushed out more of the
juice and administered it at regular intervals. "I
believe he's got a good fighting chance to pull
through. If the boys would only get back with
some whiskey an' drugs, now, I reckon, we could
save him. I wonder what can be keepin' them so
long. They've had plenty of time to make Judson
and back."</p>

<p>But the afternoon wore away without sign of the
rescuers, and a new fear crept into the old sailor's
worries. Something must have happened to the two
boys. Late in the afternoon, he left Chris long
enough to hurry down to the shore in quest of fish
or clams for supper. He found the rock from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
which he had fished completely submerged and a
heavy surf thundering far up into the marsh.
Under such conditions it was impossible to secure
fish or clams, and he returned to camp hungry, disappointed,
and with further cause for worry. The
heavy surf indicated another storm in the Gulf
which might reach where they were. If it did, it
would render their position still more uncomfortable
and dangerous. A heavy blow would continue to
cut off their supply of fish and clams and would
likely flood the low-lying marsh shutting them in on
their little island. If Chris had been well enough
to walk, the captain would have at once moved camp
to the mainland, but that was impossible now. By
sunset his fears were in a fair way to be realized.
The wind was steadily increasing in force, and,
blowing out of a clear sky, gave promise of still
greater violence. Supperless and worried, the old
sailor watched the night fall with but one thing to
cheer his drooping spirits&mdash;Chris was evidently
slowly improving. Likely much of the poison had
been drawn out from his wound by the hot mud
and the balance remaining had been overcome in
its paralyzing effects by the powerful stimulant.
The lad's pulse was slowly growing stronger and
it was clear that the crisis had been safely passed.</p>

<p>The old sailor was too worried about the absent
lads to compose himself to sleep. Already, the surf
was sending up small wavelets far into the marsh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
If the boys were returning the way they went, their
journey would be fraught with perils.</p>

<p>The sky was covered with fleecy clouds but they
disappeared with the rising of the moon and by its
bright light he could see far out on the water where
the huge waves broke foaming white on the outer
bar.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a shout that made Chris stir
in his stupor; "The boys! The boys!" he cried
in delight.</p>

<p>In the broad path of moonlight, a small schooner
appeared feeling her way through a passage in the
reef under close-reefed sails.</p>

<p>"They must have someone aboard that knows the
reef," he mused as he watched the little ship cautiously
weaving her way in between the dangerous
rocks.</p>

<p>She held steadily for the shore until she was
scarce two cable lengths from it, then, she shot up
into the wind, her anchor was dropped, and her
sails lowered.</p>

<p>The captain was down on the shore, heedless of
the flying spray, when the anchor hit the bottom.</p>

<p>"Walt! Charley!" he roared at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer and he hailed again.</p>

<p>"Ahoy! Shore!" came an answering hail from
the schooner. "Who air yo' and what do yo'
want?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain was silent for a moment with disappointment.
It was not the boys after all, but any
help was welcome at such a time and he made haste
to reply.</p>

<p>"We're two shipwrecks in bad shape an' need
help. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The Hattie Roberts, sponger, from Key West.
Stan' by, an' we'll send a boat."</p>

<p>While the strangers were launching a boat, the
captain had time to observe that the schooner's
decks were piled full of small boats and that, small
as she was, she carried a crew of at least thirty
men.</p>

<p>"An old style, pole an' hook sponger," he decided.
"I didn't reckon there was any of them
left. I 'lowed the Greeks had run 'em all out of
business."</p>

<p>Manned by half a dozen men, the little boat
came tearing through the waves towards the shore.
Flung up by a huge roller, she grounded almost at
the captain's feet. The instant she touched bottom,
her crew sprang over the side and drew her up safely
beyond the reach of the next roller. Even by the
dimmed light of the moon, the old sailor could see
that the new-comers were dark-skinned men with
heavy coarse features. He recognized them without
the aid of the peculiar accent as Conchs,&mdash;a
kind of mixed race belonging to the Florida Keys.</p>

<p>"Whar's yo's companion?" demanded one, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
from his air of authority was evidently the captain.</p>

<p>"He's on a little island just a little ways from
here. I'll have to get one of your men to help me
down with him."</p>

<p>"All right, Sam here will go with yo'. Step
lively, we have got to pull out from hyar quick.
There ain't as good anchorage as I 'lowed to find
behind the reef. We'll have to make foah a better
harbor."</p>

<p>The captain, with the sailor detailed to help him,
was hurrying off on their mission when the Conch's
skippers curiosity caused him to stop him in spite of
the preciousness of time.</p>

<p>"How did yo's git hyah in such a fix," he demanded.</p>

<p>"Been sponging with a Greek crew. Crew
mutinied. We escaped in a diving boat. Got
wrecked in the night on the reef out thar," replied
Captain Westfield, briefly.</p>

<p>"Sponging with the Greeks!" snarled the Conch
with an oath. "Then the Greeks can help yo' out
of yo'r fix, by all that's Holy, I won't. Hyah, Sam,
jump aboard with yo'."</p>

<p>"You are not agoin' to desert us?" cried the
captain in bewildered consternation. "For the love
of humanity, man, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I won't raise a finger to help any
mons who deals with the Greeks&mdash;blast 'em," cried
the Conch, fiercely. "They've ruined us an' our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
people. We used to be a happy an' prosperous race
a'fore they came with their diving suits an' tramped
all over the bottom of the Gulf. Killing the little
baby sponges with their iron shoes, an' stripping the
bottom clean as a Conch's floor. We've been run
out of the business, an' they did it. We've lost our
homes, an' they caused it. Our families don't have
enough to eat an' wear any more, an' they are the
reason&mdash;curse 'em, curse 'em, curse 'em."</p>

<p>"But you are leaving us to certain death, man!"
pleaded Captain Westfield, "The water is rising
over the marsh, already."</p>

<p>"An' it will be flooded inside of ten hours," declared
the Conch with cruel satisfaction. "All
aboard mons an' shove off."</p>

<p>Captain Westfield grasped the gunwale of the
boat and tried to hold it while he reasoned and
argued with the fanatical Conch, but the infuriated
man rapped his knuckles with an oar and gave him
a shove with the blade that sent him struggling
backwards. By the time the old sailor recovered his
balance, the boat had been shoved off and was out
of his reach. He shook his clenched fist at the
Conch's receding figure.</p>

<p>"You'll pay for this," he shouted. "No good
will come to you after such a trick." But it is
doubtful if the Conch even heard his voice above
the roar of the wind.</p>

<p>The captain stood watching grimly until the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
reached the schooner's side, and her close-reefed
sails were hoisted, her anchor broke and she headed
to the South inside the line of reef. When she had
faded away into the night, he turned back for the
camp filled with disappointment and dismay.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>THE FLOOD.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the old sailor made his way back to the
island, he was alarmed to see how rapidly the water
was rising over the marsh. He splashed knee-deep
in the water at every step and it was easy to see
that it still continued to rise with astonishing
rapidity.</p>

<p>His first act on reaching the island was to move
the camp to the highest knoll of ground, already
the lowest lying portions of the island were submerged.
Chris had regained consciousness though
he was still too weak to move without assistance.
He watched the old sailor's preparations with
evident interest and looked at the rapidly rising
water with evident anxiety.</p>

<p>"If dat water doan stop comin' up, we is sho'
goin' to hab a hard time gettin' anythin' to eat,"
he observed. "Can't get ober dem rock no way when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
dey is covered wid water, sho' to break a leg in one
ob dem holes."</p>

<p>"The Lord will watch out for us, lad," encouraged
the captain. "Look at all that He has brought
us through. He has never deserted us in our hour
of need."</p>

<p>"Golly! I reckon dat's so," agreed the little
darkey, thoughtfully. He remained quiet for a
few minutes then said quaintly, "'Spect's we
oughter ask him to look out foah Massa Charley
an' Massa Walt. I'ze getting plum anxious 'bout
dem two white chillins. Dey had oughter been back
long 'fore dis. Massa Charley's mighty clever, but
I 'spect dat it wouldn't do no harm to ax de Lawd
to help him out a bit if he's in trouble."</p>

<p>"No one can do without the Lord's help, Chris,"
the captain said, gravely, "an', I reckon, them lads
need it powerful bad. Something pretty serious
has happened, I 'low, to keep them from coming
back. We'll ask the Good Lord to watch out for
them an' protect them."</p>

<p>The old sailor knelt by the little negro's side
and in simple seafaring language prayed that the
Heavenly Father would watch over and protect the
missing ones.</p>

<p>The simple steadfast faith of the old seaman
and the trusting little negro filled them with a sense
of security and peace. They doubted not that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
humble petition would be answered and that now a
Heavenly Eye was watching over them and their
absent companions and that a Divine Hand would
guide them through their trials and danger. They
stretched out on their leafy couches and went fast
to sleep, while the storm raged and howled around
them and the rising water crept slowly up on their
little island.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when they awoke and
looked about them. It was a wild and terrifying
scene that met their eyes. The marsh between them
and the sea was completely submerged and covered
with rolling white-caps. Far out on the reef they
could see the mighty rollers flinging their spray
forty feet in the air when they struck the sunken
rocks. Of the island, none remained except the
high sands and knoll upon which was their camp.
Between the island and the mainland was two miles
of swirling, foaming water.</p>

<p>"Can't get to shore, no ways, now, Massa Captain,"
Chris observed. "You had oughter gone
in las' night when you had a chance an' left dis
nigger behind."</p>

<p>"The Lord will look out for us, lad," said the
old sailor cheerfully. "I don't calculate that the
water's going to rise high enough to cover this
knoll we are on an' as soon as the wind drops a
bit, the boys will be back for us with a boat. It's
just a matter of being patient for a little while.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
We may get a little bit hungry, but, I reckon, we
can stand that without grumbling."</p>

<p>"Sho' we can," agreed Chris, bravely. "Tho'
hit do seem like I was gettin' powerful hungry already.
Ain't dar none of dem cassava roots dat
we can get at?"</p>

<p>A close search revealed that most of the patch
of tubers was covered by the rising water. A few
plants however still showed on the little knoll and
these the captain dug at once. There was only a
scant half peck of the roots but that was better
than nothing.</p>

<p>The old sailor kindled a little fire and roasted
all the roots in the coals.</p>

<p>"We might as well have one good full meal," he
observed, "I never did take much stock in this idea
of going on short rations when grub is scarce. I
always 'lowed that one good feed would carry a
man further than a dozen pesky little ones that
only tantalize the stomach."</p>

<p>But the roots shrank greatly in the cooking, by
the time the skins were removed, there was but little
left for the hungry castaways. They still felt empty
after their meal was finished.</p>

<p>The day dragged wearily away with no sign of
abatement of the storm. The water continued to
rise slowly, but so slowly that the two anxious
watchers were not without hope that the little knoll
on which they were would escape the overflow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Their position was by no means uncomfortable.
There was no rain and the weather was so warm
that the wind did not cause them to suffer any from
cold. Aside from their growing hunger and their
anxiety about their missing companions, they were
quite comfortable. Chris, in fact, was in better
shape than at any time since they had been cast on
shore.</p>

<p>"I don' reckon dis storm can las' berry much
longer," he observed, cheerfully, when the sun went
down in a perfectly clear sky. "Dar ain't no
clouds to back up de wind an' hit's bound to play
out 'fore long."</p>

<p>"That's just where you're wrong, lad," said the
captain. "A gale from a clear sky is the worst of
all. I ain't ever seen many of them but what I have
seen were all hummers."</p>

<p>The two sat looking out on the gloomy waste of
waters until the moon, now at its full, rose and lit
up the wild scene about them almost as brightly as
day. At last they tired of the wild, gloomy, disheartening
scene, and, after a short prayer together,
stretched out on their couches. Chris was almost
instantly asleep but the captain lay long awake, his
mind full of their helpless situation, and, of anxious
conjectures as to the fate of the two absent lads.
His own position and that of his little companion
was such as to awaken his deepest fears. So long
as the storm continued, their rescue by land or Gulf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was impossible. No boat could live amongst the
rocks and raging waters which now surrounded
them. His long experience told him that the storm
was likely to continue at least two days longer.&mdash;He
had seen similar gales blow for an entire week
without a let up. Even after the gale was over,
it would take some little time for the waves and
water to subside. At the best, they would suffer
greatly from hunger before their rescue would be
possible. But, to do the old sailor justice, his
thoughts were not so much of their own situation
as of the absent lads. He could only hope and
pray that they had not started to return by water
before the breaking of the storm.</p>

<p>As he lay motionless musing, his ear caught a
low grating sound as of heavy objects drawn on
coarse sand. He quickly sat up on his couch and
looked around. In the bright moonlight he could
see large dark objects moving over the white sand.</p>

<p>"'Gators, an' a regular drove of them," he exclaimed.
"Wake up, Chris! Wake up!"</p>

<p>The little negro struggled up into a sitting position,
still half asleep.</p>

<p>"What's de matter, Massa Cap?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Look at them 'gators, thar's dozens of them.
We've got to have a fire mighty quick an' stick close
to it."</p>

<p>Chris greeted the sight of the dark objects with
a cry of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Golly! De Good Lord's dun answered our
prayers. Dem's turtles."</p>

<p>The old sailor sprang to his feet and would have
dashed for the nearest object if the little negro had
not restrained him.</p>

<p>"You sho' scare dem all away if you do dat way,"
he cautioned. "Jus' wait till dey gets to layin' an'
you can walk right up on 'em."</p>

<p>The huge creatures crept steadily on up the shelving
knoll. Their progress was slow and clumsy,
and their lower shells dragging over the sand had
made the grinding noise the captain had heard.
They crept up to within ten feet of where the two
watchers lay, then, they halted, and, with their hind
flippers began to dig deep holes in the soft sand.</p>

<p>"Dey lays der eggs in dem holes an' covers dem
up wid sand," Chris explained in a whisper. "Dey
each lays mighty nigh two hundred eggs. De warm
sand hatches out de little turtles."</p>

<p>The two castaways waited until the great sea
hens had begun to lay, then Chris arose and walked
directly for them without any attempt at concealment.
The turtles did not pay the slightest attention
to his approach.</p>

<p>"We'll take dese two smallest ones," he announced.
"Dey will be de tenderest. Jus' grab de
shell wid me, Massa Cap, back by de hind flippers
an' we'll flop 'em over on his back. Keep youah
eyes an' mouth shut."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old sailor was too excited to heed the
advice. He grabbed the turtle's shell and heaved,
then staggered back spitting and coughing with
mouth, eyes, and ears full of sand, which the
creature with it's flippers sent flying in a cloud about
it.</p>

<p>Chris waited until he had relieved himself of the
stinging sand and this time the captain, following
his advice, kept mouth and eyes tightly closed. A
few seconds sufficed to turn the two turtles on their
backs where they lay helpless.</p>

<p>There must have been at least thirty turtles in
the bunch but the castaways contented themselves
with only turning the two, any more would have
been useless slaughter. Those unmolested quickly
completed their laying, covered the eggs and retreated
to the water.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>THE FLOATING HATCH.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> castaways lost no time in rejoicing over
their good fortune. The Captain hastily kindled a
fire while Chris, with his sheath knife, proceeded to
butcher the smallest of the two turtles. Much experience
had made the little negro expert at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
work and in a few minutes he had severed the two
shells and cut off several thick steaks from one of
the hind flippers. Then, squatting before the fire,
each impaled a steak on the end of a pointed stick
and toasted it over the coals.</p>

<p>How good the steaming juicy meat tasted to the
two hungry ones. Steak after steak was broiled
and eaten before their ravenous appetites were
satisfied and they could eat no more.</p>

<p>"Midnight is a sorter unusual hour for a feed,"
Captain Westfield observed, "but, I reckon, we will
sleep none the worse for it. I 'low, we ain't got to
lay awake none worryin' about food now. Thar's
meat enough to last us for two weeks at least."</p>

<p>"An' maybe, Ole Mister Gale will blow hisself
out," said Chris, hopefully, as, yawning sleepily he
stretched himself again on his couch.</p>

<p>It was broad day when the castaways awoke from
the heavy slumber which had followed their hearty
midnight supper. They found the gale still blowing
with undiminished violence and the sky still brightly
blue. One thing, however, gave them great satisfaction,
the water had ceased to encroach upon their
little knoll. It had evidently reached its height.</p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast of turtle steaks, the
two proceeded at once to dress and cure the turtles,
for they well knew that under the sun's heat the
fresh meat would soon spoil.</p>

<p>They had neither salt nor smoke house with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
which to cure it, but they went at the task with sure
confidence in the result. The meat was first cut
away from the shells and skinned, care being taken
to remove every particle of the greenish-colored
fat. Then, cutting across the grain, the meat was
divided into thin strips and spread upon leaves to
dry in the hot sun. It only remained for them to
protect it from the dews of night and chance rains
and a few days would see it thoroughly cured and
capable of keeping sweet and good so long as it was
kept dry.</p>

<p>With some hazy idea that they might be of some
future use, the captain cleaned and washed out the
two, great, trough-like, upper shells of the turtles.</p>

<p>"Dat looks like a lump of wreckage out dar by
de reef, Massa Cap," Chris observed as he
straightened up from his task of spreading out the
meat. "Pears like de tide is settin' hit in dis
way."</p>

<p>"It is a bit of wreckage or a clump of seaweed,"
the captain agreed after a brief survey. "It's drifting
in all right, but it's going to miss the island by
a good hundred yards."</p>

<p>The two suspended work while they watched the
drifting object slowly near their island.</p>

<p>"It looks like a hatch with something like a stack
atop of it," he observed to the captain as the object
drew close.</p>

<p>"Hit's a man or 'ooman atop ob hit," cried Chris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
whose eyes were keener than the old sailor's. "He's
layin' plum still, jes' like he was dead."</p>

<p>Closer approach of the object convinced the captain
that the little negro was correct. There was
beyond doubt a motionless body lying on the low
floating hatch. It was evident too that the hatch
with its burden would pass the island at a distance
of at least one hundred and fifty yards. To venture
out and attempt to tow it in was to assume a terrible
risk. The water between it and the island was raging
and tossing over dozens of dangerous hidden
rocks. Only the strongest swimmer would have the
slightest chance of success, and, even should he
succeed, it might be to find that he had risked his
life to rescue a corpse. But the ocean breeds in its
followers a brotherhood that leads them to deeds of
quiet heroism. They never know when they may
be in need of a rescuing hand and it is seldom that
one turns aside from the rendering of service, no
matter how dangerous it may be to himself.</p>

<p>When the hatch with its burden was nearly
abreast of the island Chris began to strip off his
clothes, but the Captain stopped him.</p>

<p>"You're still too weak to attempt it, lad," he declared.
"You couldn't make it thar an' back, I
reckon I can fight it out all right. I've mighty nigh
got back all my strength."</p>

<p>Hastily stripping off the pants and shirt in which
he was clothed, the old sailor slipped off into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
water and struck out for the wreckage with long
steady strokes, warily avoiding the foaming spots
which marked the positions of the larger rocks.
The swim was not difficult for so experienced a
swimmer. The struggle would come when he
attempted to return with his burden. In a few
minutes, he reached the wreckage and, resting his
hand upon the hatch gazed down at the burden it
bore. He saw a man, apparently about forty years
of age, attired in rough seaman's garb, his face
bronzed and seamed from long years of exposure
to wind and weather. The stranger was lying flat
on his back on the hatch, his legs dangling over the
end. A rope passed around his body and under the
wood work prevented the larger seas from washing
him off his frail support. He was unconscious and
the captain reached over and placed his ear close
to his chest. He could detect a faint beating of
the heart. It was slow and feeble but still it was
beating,&mdash;the man was alive.</p>

<p>Once satisfied of this fact, the old sailor quickly
shifted to the end of the hatch, and, resting one
hand upon it, and striking out with the other hand
and both feet, strove to force it back to the island.
He had not accomplished half the distance with his
burden when he saw that he could not hope to succeed.
The tide was slowly but surely sweeping him
in past the island direct for the mainland. Still,
he battled desperately on, swimming with all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
strength. Suddenly the little raft seemed to move
forward with increased speed.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Massa Cap," sounded Chris' voice
close to his elbow. "We can make it togedder all
right." The plucky little negro had been quick to
see the danger and equally quick to come to the
rescue.</p>

<p>Between the two, after half an hour of heartbreaking
battling with the current, they managed
to shove the raft ashore, where they sank exhausted
and panting upon the sand.</p>

<p>As soon as they were able to move, they unlashed
the unconscious sailor from the hatch, and, carrying
him up, laid him upon the captain's couch. The
man seemed nearly dead, and for hours the
two, wet, exhausted castaways worked over him,
struggling to coax the spark of life into a flame. At
last they were rewarded by seeing a tinge of color
creep into the bronzed face. At length the sailor
sighed and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Water," he gasped, faintly.</p>

<p>"Golly! I should reckon he's had 'bout enough
water," Chris exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Get some for him quick," Captain Westfield
commanded. "The salt brine he has swallowed
has parched his throat and stomach."</p>

<p>The sailor took only one mouthful of the proffered
water, then spat it out with his face twitching.</p>

<p>"Salt, salt," he murmured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>A horrible fear seized the captain. He snatched
the shell from Chris' hand and took a swallow of
the water. His fear was confirmed, it was salt.
The Gulf had risen close enough to their little well
to percolate through the sand into it and render it
as salt as itself.</p>

<p>The little negro divined the situation from the
captain's face. "Golly! dat's bad," he cried.
"Doin' widout water is a heap wurser den doin'
widout food."</p>

<p>"Water, give me water," pleaded the rescued
man. "My throat's parched, parched."</p>

<p>"You shall have some water as soon as we can
get it," Captain Westfield assured him. There was
something vaguely familiar to the old sailor in the
man's queerly accented speech. It was more puzzling
as he had no recollection of ever having seen
the man before.</p>

<p>Considering his low condition the sailor recovered
his full senses and a measure of his strength with
astonishing rapidity. It was plain that he had not
been deprived of either food or water for any great
length of time. He was soon able to sit up and take
notice of his surroundings. A curious look stole
over his bronzed face as his gaze took in the two
castaways.</p>

<p>"How did I get hyah?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Captain Westfield related the story of the rescue
briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailor's rough features worked with emotion.
"I remember part," he cried. "Our vessel struck
on Needle Rocks in the darkness an' went down like
a stone. I had just time to throw myself on the
hatch an' pass a rope around my waist. The crew,"
he shuddered&mdash;"must have all been dashed to
pieces against the rocks. God knows how I escaped.
An' yo' risked yo'r lives to save mine, yo' an' that
boy. Mon, how could yo' forgive me enough to do
such a deed?"</p>

<p>"Forgive you?" echoed the captain, puzzled.
"I had nothin' to forgive."</p>

<p>"I am Rufus Sanders, the Key West sponger who
refused yo'r appeals for help an' left yo' to yo'r
fate," cried the man, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I did not know that, but it would have made no
difference," said the captain, gently. "You were a
helpless, shipwrecked man." He checked the flood
of thanks on the sponger captain's lips. "You have
nothing to thank us for," he declared. "We have
only saved you from one fate to suffer a worse with
us. We are hopelessly imprisoned on this island,
an' we have no water. All we can do is endure,
pray an' hope."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>WITH THE BOYS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Considering</span> the misfortunes which had befallen
them, the two chums were in surprisingly good
spirits, as they picked their way through the marsh,
headed South. It was a relief to be free from the
dread and apprehension under which they had labored
for so many days.</p>

<p>"I feel almost as though we were on a picnic,
instead of being shipwrecked sailors who have been
robbed of their ship, and have lost all except the
clothes on their backs," Charley declared.</p>

<p>"Everything is going to turn out all right after
all," agreed Walter, hopefully. "Chris is going to
get over his wound all right. He and the captain
will have no trouble in getting plenty of food and
water. We had ought to reach Judson by dark, and
we'll get a boat or wagon and return for them at
once. We can easily get from Judson to Tarpon,
and there we can get the United States Commissioner
to take up our case, and the minute the
'Beauty' enters port she will be seized and held for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
us. At the worst it will only mean the loss of our
diving boat and a little patient waiting. And think
of the store of gold which will be ours for a little
work."</p>

<p>But his chum was not quite so optimistic. "I do
not think that we had better build too great hopes
on recovering either our ship or the gold," he observed.
"That Manuel is a clever rascal. I fear
he will rise to the occasion. He may think that we
are wrecked in the storm but I am convinced he
will take no chances. He will plan and scheme to
the last to secure the ship and money and save his
own neck from the halter. He may be caught at
last but he will not sail boldly into any port. He's
too wary for that."</p>

<p>His words did not dampen Walter's high spirits.
"There is a revenue cutter at Tarpon," reminded
his chum. "As soon as we get to Judson, we will
telegraph to the Commissioner. He will not wait
for the 'Beauty' to touch a port if we can put our
case strong enough. He will start the cutter out in
search of her at once."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right. If we are going to make
Judson before dark, however, we are going to have
to travel faster than we are going now. It's slow
going amongst this mud and rock. Let us make our
way inshore and see if it's any better traveling
there."</p>

<p>But as they approached close to the mainland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
they saw that there was no hopes of easier traveling
in that direction. The dense hammock jungle extended
down to the edge of the marsh. To make
one's way through it would be far slower than to
continue over the marsh. They, accordingly, retraced
their steps to the water's edge. It was
slightly easier traveling close to the water. The
waves had beat down the marsh grass along the
edge leaving a kind of beach of rock and mud. It
was hard and dangerous walking but safer than over
the marsh itself, where the rank growth hid the
treacherous bog holes.</p>

<p>The boys often paused in their march to examine
the masses of stuff that had been cast up by the
waves. The squall of the night before had robbed
the bottom of great masses of seaweed and had
taken heavy toll of the life in the water. Every few
minutes the lads would pass great clumps of seaweed
tangled together in beautiful rainbows of
bright scarlets, yellows, crimsons and purples. Curiously
enough, the storm had dealt very harshly with
the finny tribe. Likely many of the fish had been
caught in shoal water and their lives beaten out
against the cruel rocks. They dotted the shore and
the chums frequently halted to admire one's curious
shape or coloring.</p>

<p>"I wonder what kind this one is?" said Walter,
pointing to a long slim fish of a beautiful brilliant
green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a parrot fish," his chum enlightened
him. "I think they are one of the most beautiful
fishes that swim. They are of all colors, some are
violet, some of golden, some scarlet, and in fact,
they are found of every shade and hue. They get
their names from their many brilliant colors, I
guess."</p>

<p>"What a wonderful mysterious thing the sea is,"
Walter commented. "I never realized before how
much of strange life it contains."</p>

<p>"What we see along the beach this morning is
only a very small sample of its population," his
chum replied. "Sometimes, I think that all life
must have come first from the sea. There is hardly
an animal on land which has not a grotesque likeness
in some creature of the sea. Take that fish there
with the peculiarly shaped head and horns. Its
resemblance to a cow is so striking that it has been
named the cow fish. There is another little fish with
a head just like a horse. It is called the sea horse.
Then there is the toad fish, the frog fish, the snake
fish, and hundreds of others closely resembling the
animals after which they are named. But here," he
concluded, "is, in my opinion, the most wonderful
fish I have ever heard of. I have seen many of them
but one always has a puzzling fascination to me."</p>

<p>He had stopped before a flat round-shaped fish
which lay stranded in the edge of the water. It was
still alive and struggling feebly to get back into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
deeper water. It was of a light-tan color and was
covered with spots of darker hue. On its upper
surface was a soft, spongy-looking, circular spot
It was not a pretty looking object and Walter
viewed it with disgust.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything fascinating about it," he
commented.</p>

<p>"Just put your finger on that soft spongy place,"
Charley directed, "that's where it's wonderful
secret is concealed. It is not poisonous," he added
as his chum hesitated.</p>

<p>Walter bent down and pressed his finger against
the spongy mass. The next instant he leaped back
with a cry of alarm, shaking his arm madly.
"Jerusalem!" he exclaimed. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Got a shock did you?" laughed his chum.
"That's an electrical fish. Their mystery to me
lies in where they get the electricity with which they
are charged. Even a small one like that contains
enough to give a powerful shock."</p>

<p>The morning had been advancing rapidly as they
walked and talked and the sun was shining down
hot on their bare heads. Charley, justifying Chris'
confidence in him, was quick to recognize the danger
from its torrid rays.</p>

<p>He cast a look up at the sun. "It is nearly
noon," he declared. "We must get something to
cover our heads with and then find something to
eat. I am getting as hungry as a wolf."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing along the rocky, muddy beach
that would do for hats and the two bent their steps
in towards the mainland. There, they broke off
small leafy branches and thrust the stems down
the backs of their shirts so that the leaves would
tower above, and shade their heads. These made
only a poor substitute for hats, but shed off the
fiercest rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Close to where they broke off the boughs was a
small running stream and the boys drank thankfully
of its cold sweet water.</p>

<p>"We have no time to waste in cooking and I fear
our bill-o-fare for dinner will be rather scanty,"
Charley said. "Let's look around here and see if
we cannot find fruit of some kind."</p>

<p>There were palmetto berries in plenty all along
the high bank but the lads had no desire to partake
of them except in a case of necessity. Seeing nothing
promising along the edge of the jungle, they
scrambled up the bank and made their way slowly
and cautiously into the hammock, keeping a wary
eye out for snakes. They found fruit of several
kinds in abundance, but most of it Charley rejected
as being poisonous, or not fit to eat. They gathered
two kinds which he declared were both palatable
and nourishing. One was a golden-red fruit about
the size of a pear. It contained a large nut to which
the meat clung closely. One bite into it and the
boys' hands and faces were smeared with sticky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
juice. "I would recognize that smeary juice and
strong turpentine flavor, anywhere," laughed
Walter, "these are mangoes, the fruit, they say,
you have got to get into a bath-tub to eat if you
want to keep clean."</p>

<p>The second fruit was about the size of a large
plum and snow white in color with a blotch of red
on the sides. Its meat was sweet, milky and
slightly puckering.</p>

<p>"They are cocoa-plums," Charley explained.
"They are considered quite nutritious but I would
be afraid to eat a great many of them at a time on
account of their puckerishness. We can eat all we
want to of the mangoes however, they will not
hurt us."</p>

<p>As soon as their repast was finished the boys
filled their pockets with mangoes and cocoa-plums
and hastened back to the shore.</p>

<p>They plodded steadily along while the afternoon
wore away, but their progress over the rocks and
mud was slow and they realized that they would
not be able to reach Judson before darkness
rendered further traveling dangerous.</p>

<p>They were passing a matted clump of seaweed
on the shore when Charley, stopping with a cry of
delight, fished out from its midst a round piece of
wood about four feet in length, from which trailed
a long, light line badly frayed in places by the rock.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize this?" he shouted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," replied his chum in wonder at his excitement.</p>

<p>"It's the buoy that marked the place where the
gold ship lay. The Greeks will have a job to locate
the gold now. That storm must have chafed the
rope in two against a ledge of coral. Hurrah,
hurrah."</p>

<p>"I don't see but that is as bad news for us as for
the Greeks," Walter said, dubiously.</p>

<p>"It is, in a way," his chum replied. "Of course
it will make it harder for us to find the exact spot
where the treasure lays, but the Greeks will be
delayed by it and that will give us a chance to get
there with the revenue cutter and catch them before
they get all the gold removed and get away."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>THE JOURNEY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> still lacked about an hour to sundown when
Charley called a halt. "We cannot possibly make
Judson before night, and it would be sheer foolishness
to try to travel over these rocks after it gets
dark," he declared. "We would be sure to get
some bad falls and very likely break an arm or leg.
The best thing we can do is to find a good place to
camp while it is still light and make ourselves as
snug as possible for the night."</p>

<p>Walter, who was beginning to feel tired out from
the long day's tramp, was quick to agree with his
proposal and the two lads headed in for the mainland,
for neither felt any desire to spend the night
on the wet, muddy marsh.</p>

<p>Good fortune seemed to guide their footsteps for
they struck the mainland just where a little stream
of clear water bubbled forth amongst a clump of
towering cedars.</p>

<p>"The very place for our camp," Charley exclaimed.
"You see what you can fix up in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of a shelter, Walt, while I look around and see
what I can find for our supper."</p>

<p>Walter was fast becoming an adept at the science
of woodcraft and he went about his task with certainty
and dispatch. First, he broke off armsful of
small boughs which he spread in two piles upon the
ground close to the trunks of two big cedar trees.
These were to serve as their couches and over them
he proceeded to erect a rough lean-to to protect them
from the wind and dew. There were plenty of dead
boughs all around, and, selecting two of the longest
and straightest, he leaned them against the trunk
of the two trees about six feet from the ground,
embedding their other ends firmly in the ground.
Across these, he laid other limbs a couple of feet
apart and upon them piled palmetto leaves and
boughs to form a roof. Before the open front of
the rude structure, he built a roaring fire of dead
cedar limbs. Close beside it he piled up a huge
heap of wood with which to keep the fire replenished
throughout the night. This completed his labors,
and stretching himself upon his springy, fragrant
couch before the crackling fire, he waited hungrily
for his chum's return. He was becoming alarmed
over his long absence when there came a crackling
of boughs and Charley strode into the circle of firelight,
bearing in one hand a snow-white heart, or
bud, of a cabbage palmetto and in the other, a chunk
of fresh meat several pounds in weight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you got there?" he inquired,
eagerly.</p>

<p>Charley grinned, "I'm too hungry to stop and tell
you now. Sharpen up a couple of sticks and we'll
broil some steaks, then, I'll give you three guesses
as to what it is, and bet that you don't guess right."</p>

<p>Walter hastily cut two long green palmetto stems
and sharpened them to points at the ends. By the
time he had them ready, Charley had cut a couple of
generous-sized steaks from the hunk of meat. The
balance of it he wrapped up in a couple of green
palmetto leaves and buried in the coals. While the
steaks impaled upon the sticks were sizzling appetizingly
before the fire, he wrapped up the palmetto
heart in green leaves and buried it beside the roasting
meat.</p>

<p>So hungry was Walter that he cut bits from his
steak before it was fairly done and devoured them
with eager appetite.</p>

<p>"Like it?" inquired his chum with a twinkle in
his eye.</p>

<p>"Fine, it only needs a little salt to make it
perfect," Walter declared. "I can't quite place it
though. It tastes like a cross between pork and
beefsteak. What is it anyway?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"Pork?"</p>

<p>"Nit."</p>

<p>"Coon?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nit."</p>

<p>"Opossum?"</p>

<p>"Nit."</p>

<p>"I give it up then. What kind of animal is it?"</p>

<p>"I found it on the bank of a little creek not far
from here," said Charley, dreamily. "It was sound
asleep and it did not look very pretty or innocent
even in its slumber, but beggars can't be choosers,
so I got me a good heavy club and crept up on it
softly. When it woke up I was near enough to give
it a good rap over the head. It gave me a couple
of good licks in the shins with its tail, however, before
I got it killed."</p>

<p>Walter rose in his indignation, "Why didn't you
tell me at the start that it was alligator meat," he
demanded, "I would not have eaten a mouthful of
it."</p>

<p>"And you'd gone hungry to bed," said his chum
with a chuckle. "You'd have let your prejudice
cheat you out of a good meal. It tastes all right,
don't it."</p>

<p>"Yes," Walter admitted, ruefully, "and, now
that I've eaten some of it, I might as well keep right
on eating."</p>

<p>"Wise lad," Charley approved. "Let me tell
you there are lots worse things than alligator steaks
when one is hungry."</p>

<p>The steaks disposed of, the boys attacked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
roasted meat and palmetto cabbage with such
vigorous appetites that there was but little left when
their hunger was at last appeased.</p>

<p>"Pretty slim show for breakfast," said Charley,
ruefully, as he eyed the scanty remains. "Let's see
if we can't fix up some way to catch something during
the night."</p>

<p>The plan which they finally decided upon to
accomplish this was very simple. With their sharp
knives, they whittled out several sets of figure-four
setters, and, dragging several small logs just outside
the circle of firelight, they placed a figure-four
setter under an end of each and baited the triggers
with bits of meat left from their supper. An
animal nosing around after the bait would be sure
to spring the setter and cause the log to descend
upon it.</p>

<p>"We will surely get a coon or opossum before
morning," Charley declared. "Animals have lots
of curiosity and some of them are sure to be
attracted by the light of our camp-fire. The smell
of the cooked meat will attract them also."</p>

<p>This last task completed, the boys stretched themselves
on their soft couches before the cheery fire
whose rays danced and flickered amongst the leafy
greenness of their shelter. It was a cozy, cheery
little camp and the two lads lay long awake, talking
hopefully with the cheery optimism that waits
upon a hearty supper and healthy vigorous youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
When at last they fell asleep, it was with confident
hope of a successful morrow.</p>

<p>It seemed to Walter that he had barely fallen
asleep when he was struggling in that nightmare
state which lies halfway between slumber and
entire wakefulness. He struggled pantingly for
breath, but every breath he drew seemed to stifle
him. Oppressed with black horror, he fought his
way back to consciousness. But wakefulness
brought small relief. The air was heavy with a
stench that nauseated and sickened him.</p>

<p>Charley, crouched beside the fire, was holding his
nose with one hand, his face expressing unutterable
disgust.</p>

<p>"What in the world is the matter?" Walter demanded.</p>

<p>"One of our traps worked," announced his chum,
grimly. "It's only a little skunk, but my, what a
big smell."</p>

<p>"I should say so," Walter agreed. "We can't
stay here. We'll have to move camp."</p>

<p>"I second the motion to adjourn," said his chum,
solemnly.</p>

<p>No time was lost in debating the question and the
lads quickly took their departure from their cozy
camp. They made their way cautiously along the
edge of the hammock until the raucous odor was
left behind, then they halted and built another fire.</p>

<p>"The measly little varmint," said Walter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
wrathfully, as they crouched beside the blaze.
"He's gone and cheated us out of a good night's
sleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't as bad as all that," said his chum,
cheerfully. "It's nearly morning now. See, there's
the morning star in the East. Besides," he added,
whimsically, "That poor little fellow isn't to blame.
He didn't ask us to set a trap for him. I bet he
regrets the accident as much as we do." Then
throwing back his head he sang in his clear tenor
voice, "Driven From Home."</p>

<p>As the humor of the incident dawned upon
Walter, he burst into laughter in which he was
joined by his fun-loving chum.</p>

<p>It was too near morning to consider selecting
another shelter so the two sat beside the fire until
day broke, then they made their way back to the
camp to examine their traps. All were sprung, but,
outside of the skunk, the only victims were an opossum
and a coon which they bore back to their new
fire. The opossum they broiled and ate for breakfast
while the coon they roasted to carry along with
them for dinner.</p>

<p>Sunrise found them once more on the march
headed South.</p>

<small>JUDSON.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> noon the two lads estimated that they must
have come at least twenty miles from where they
had left the captain and Chris, and, if the old sailor
had been right in his reckoning, they could not be
far from their objective point, the town of Judson.
They began now to keep a sharp watch ahead and
ere long were rewarded by the sight of a low black
line projecting out from the marsh ahead. A closer
approach resolved the low black line into a long,
shaky, decrepit wharf, its piling rotting from age
and neglect and its timbers and planking fast falling
into decay. On the mainland back of the marsh a
few rude cabins, each at least a half a mile distant
from its nearest neighbor, rose from the middles of
wide neglected fields. One lone, aged sloop rode at
anchor near the wharf. The little port and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
hamlet itself seemed to wear an air of deadly decay,
sadness and gloom.</p>

<p>"Not a very cheerful or prosperous-looking
place," Charley observed as they clambered up on
the wharf and made their way ashore over its shaky
timbers.</p>

<p>"No," his chum agreed, "but I am thankful to
reach it, poor as it is. My feet are getting sore
from tramping over these rocks, I can tell you."</p>

<p>At the shore end of the dock the two paused long
enough to take a more careful survey of the place.</p>

<p>"I declare it looks as though it was deserted or
all the inhabitants dead," Walter said nervously,
"See how the roads are all grown up with weeds as
though they were never used. There is no sign of
anyone about either."</p>

<p>"Just notice those cabins," his chum exclaimed,
"They look just like the pictures I have seen of
houses the first settlers used to build during the
Indian times. They are built of great logs and
have loopholes like the forts of those days. What
a queer place!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's smoke coming from the chimney
of that nearest cabin, and there seems to be someone
working out in the field by it," said Walter with
a sigh of relief. "I was beginning to think it was
an abandoned village."</p>

<p>The two bent their steps towards the cabin
indicated. It was set in a square clearing of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
twenty acres, that was surrounded by a strip of
pine woods which separated it from its nearest
neighbor. As they drew nearer, they could see a
man at work near the cabin. He was ploughing up
the ground with a rude plow hitched to a yoke of
oxen.</p>

<p>As the boys stepped out of the road into the
clearing, they were greeted by savage barks, and a
pack of dogs lolling around the cabin woke into
sudden life and came tearing towards them.</p>

<p>The man at the plough let go the handles and
sprang into the cabin. The next minute a rifle
barrel protruded from one of the loopholes, "Halt
right where you-all is," called a voice from behind
the rifle.</p>

<p>"Call off your dogs," shouted Charley, as he and
Walter, snatching up a couple of sticks, endeavored
to keep the growling, snapping curs at bay.</p>

<p>"Who are you-alls an' what do you want?" demanded
the holder of the rifle.</p>

<p>"We were shipwrecked twenty-five miles up the
coast. We want supplies and help to bring in two
companions, one of whom is badly hurt," answered
Charley.</p>

<p>"Come closer an' let me have a good look at you-all,"
commanded the cabin's occupant, "Here yu
Bet, yu Tige, yu Jim, be still thar," he called to the
snarling pack which slunk growling away at his
harsh commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys drew near the cabin in obedience to
his order. A brief survey of them seemed to convince
its owner that they were not what he feared.
The cabin door was flung open, and, rifle in hand,
he appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Come in you-alls an' have a cheer," he invited.
"I'll jis' unhitch them oxen an' then, while I'm
rustling up a bit of supper, you-alls can give me
your story."</p>

<p>The tired, hungry boys accepted his invitation
with alacrity, and, while he was busy unharnessing
the yoke of steers, they seated themselves in a couple
of rude home-made chairs, and gazed curiously
about them.</p>

<p>The cabin was about twenty feet square. Its
rough log walls were whitewashed, and its pine-slab
floor spotlessly clean. At one end was a big old-fashioned
fireplace from the rafters above which
hung home-cured hams, slabs of bacon, and strings
of sausages. A barrel in a corner was heaped high
with huge, sweet, sugary yams. Several boxes beside
it were heaped with onions, cabbages, carrots,
pumpkins, and other vegetables. In another corner
stood a barrel of home-ground corn meal and a big
hogshead of water. Taken all in all, the little
cabin's interior was a sight to fill the two hungry
lads with satisfied anticipation. They had hardly
completed their survey of it when their strange host<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
entered latching and bolting the heavy door behind
him.</p>

<p>He was a man about forty years of age, strongly
built, but sallow with the sallowness of the native
Floridian. His face was kindly in expression but
stamped on its every line was a look of uneasiness
and apprehension. It was not an expression of
fear but rather the look of a brave man who was
simply on his guard every moment against expected
dangers.</p>

<p>"I sho' have got to ask you-all to excuse me fur
the way I dun greeted you," he apologized, "but,
you see, strangers are mighty scarse around hyar
an' one has to be plum' careful. I'se powerful glad
to see a new face though&mdash;it's been mighty nigh
two years since I had talk with a stranger. I
reckon, you-alls must be some hungry. I'll rustle
up a little supper while you-all gives me your tale."</p>

<p>With a deftness that indicated long batching experience,
he cut great slices of ham and placed them
to broil over the coals, mixed a pone of corn bread
and put it to bake in a Dutch oven, and buried a
dozen big yams to roast among the embers. While
he was thus engaged, Charley related the story of
their voyage and shipwreck omitting only any mention
of the gold. His story was frequently interrupted
by his host's exclamations, "I swan, an' dew
tell." When the lad had finished, the stranger
beamed upon him with evident pleasure. "I swan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
hit's jis' like a novel I read once," he declared, "hit
was writ by a fellow called Russell, Clark Russell,
if I don't disremember his name. I don't reckon
his story was true though. I 'lows he just made it
up outer his head&mdash;but the vittals is ready now, you-alls
jis' back up to the table thar an' helps yourselves."</p>

<p>The hungry boys needed no second invitation but
fell to work on the tender juicy ham and sugary
yams with hearty appetites while their host as he
ate, watched them with evident pleasure at their
enjoyment. When all had finished, he put away the
dishes, filled his corn-cob pipe, and leaned back in
his chair against the wall.</p>

<p>"You-alls can't go back to whar yu left the
captain an' the little nigger to-night, noways," he
observed.</p>

<p>"No," Charley agreed, "but we would like to
start back early in the morning if we can get a
wagon or a boat."</p>

<p>"Thar ain't no fitten road for a wagon leading up
the coast," observed their host. "I owns that little
sloop anchored down thar by the dock. I reckon,
you-alls could make out with her. I don't reckon
them Wrights would stop you-alls from going if
they understood jis' how things stood. I don't 'low
they would be so pesky pisen mean as all that. I'd
like to go with you-alls an' see that ole captain an'
that little nigger, I sho' would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"We would like to have you go with us," said
Walter, eagerly. "Why can't you?"</p>

<p>"'Cause I don't ever expect to leave this hyar
cabin alive," said his host, calmly.</p>

<p>The boys stared at him in uneasy astonishment.</p>

<p>"No, I ain't crazy," said the man quietly.
"Hush, jis' lis'en' a bit."</p>

<p>A long prolonged growl came from one of the
dogs outside. The man arose and taking up his
rifle stepped over to the loophole beckoning to the
lads to follow. The moon lit up the little clearing
almost as light as day. The dogs were moving
around outside, sniffing and uttering low growls.</p>

<p>The boys could see nothing unusual in the clearing
but they felt a sense of danger in the very air.
Their host's eyes, more accustomed to the surroundings
than their own, evidently detected something
ominous in one of the shadows thrown out
from the belt of pines. He thrust the barrel of his
rifle out through the loophole and the next instant
its sharp crack rent the stillness of the night. The
lurking shadow vanished amongst the pines with
a whoop of defiance.</p>

<p>Their host pulled in his rifle, "A plum' miss,"
he said, disgustedly, "Wall, the war is on for fair
now. Better outen that light an' draw your cheers
up by the fire an' I'll tell you'alls about hit."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>THE FEUD.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Thar</span> ain't no call to keep watch at the loopholes,"
said their host as the alarmed lads' glances
kept wandering towards the dark openings. "The
dogs will tell we-alls if anyone tries to come near
the cabin." He leaned back in his chair in silence
for a few minutes gazing into the heart of the fire
whose flickering rays lit up his bronzed, thoughtful,
kindly face.</p>

<p>"Hit all began years ago when I warn't but a
little bit of a shaver," he began, quietly. "Judson
was a right-prosperous, happy, contented, little
place, then. Thar was mighty nigh a hundred people
living in the town, an' in the woods nigh about
hyar. Each family had hit's own little cabin an'
farm an' raised all hit's own living of meat, corn,
taters, an' sugar cane, an' each family had hit's patch
of cotton with which they bought what things they
needed that they didn't raise themselves. We had a
right tidy little schoolhouse. I went to hit two terms
when I was a little shaver," he said with evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
pride, "an' I learned how to read an' write pretty
well&mdash;the reading's been a heap of company to me
during the years since then. Each family had a
plenty to eat an' wear, an' thar warn't none that
you could call real poor people like I hearn tell you-alls
have in the North. We used to have dances
and barbecues, an' picnics an' a right sociable time.
The town was started by two families, the Turners
an' the Wrights&mdash;I'm a Turner,&mdash;an' all the people
about was kin to one or the other family, which
made everybody friendly and sociable with each
other. Hit was jis' a little Eden on earth, this
place, 'till the serpent came twisting an' crawlin' in.
The devil must have sho' had a hand in making
some of the men folks believe that the Good Lord
intended the honest corn they raised for anything
but food for man an' beast. Yes, I reckon, hit sho'
must have been ole Satan that made a few of the
Turners an' Wrights get together an' start a little
whiskey still over thar in the woods yonder. The
womin folks was again hit from the start, as, bless
their hearts, they've always been again the cursed
stuff. Hit was Christmas week that the still was
started goin', an' Christmas Eve the ones running
hit gave a big barbecue at the still to celebrate it.
Most everyone went, as they always did to doin's in
the neighborhood. Even my daddy an' two brothers,
Ben an' Abe, went to see the fun as they called
hit, but mammy she was a good, religious woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>,
she staid at home an' kept me with her. She would
have liked to keep the other boys with her too, but
they had grown out of her control as boys sometimes
do." His bronzed face grew sadly thoughtful,
as he continued, "I recollect, I cried because I
couldn't go too, but mother sang to me an' tole me
stories&mdash;mother was a powerful hand at telling the
kind of stories boys like an' I soon quit cryin' an'
went to sleep quiet an' happy with mother singing
to me. Hit was the last time I ever heard mammy
sing. I reckon hit was 'bout midnight when a noise
woke me up. The door had been flung open&mdash;hit
was never locked in them days&mdash;an' father an' Abe
came rushin' in. Father's face was white as a sheet
an' I'll never forget the look on mammy's face. Hit
seemed as if she knowed without a word from
daddy what had happened. Thar was a curious
tremble in her voice as she asked, 'Whar's Ben?'
At the sound of her voice father broke down an'
sobbed like a child. 'He's dead,' he cried.
'They've killed my boy Ben. Those Wrights have
killed my boy Ben.'"</p>

<p>The man paused as the recollection of that terrible
scene crowded his mind, while the two lads
looked at each other with sympathetic horror.</p>

<p>"No one seemed to know just how the trouble
started," went on their host, quietly. "All hands
had taken a little too much liquor, there had been a
few hot words, a blow, an' Ben had keeled over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
with a knife in his side. Then the fightin' started
between the kin of both families, an' daddy an' Abe
had run home to git their guns. Sore at heart as
mammy was, she begged 'em not to shed no more
blood but to leave it to the cotes, for mammy, as I
have said, was a religious woman. But both
Wrights and Turners came first from the mountains
of Kentucky whar man don't go to law again'
man but settles his quarrels with his rifle, An' so
the blood-feud began. Thar was more than Ben
killed that night,&mdash;Wrights as well as Turners.
When all had sobered up from the liquor thar came
a kind of lull or truce, but war always bruk out
again when either families got to drinkin'. They
got Abe the followin' year, but not 'fore he had
shot a couple of Wrights. Hit was three years
afore they got father. Mother, she pined away an'
died soon after they got him. I think she was
kinder glad to go, such things are wearin' on a
woman. An' so the killin's been goin' on ever since
by spells when the liquor gets to flowin'. I am the
only Turner alive, now, though thar's a few of my
kin still scattered around hyar. I've been shot at a
powerful lot of times, but, I reckon, I've been lucky.
Then too, they ain't none of them hunted me so
powerful hard, for I ain't took no part in any of
the killin's. I've shot a couple of times to scare
them away but not to kill. My own kin 'lows that
I'm poor-spirited, but somehow or other, I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
forget the look on mammy's face the night Ben was
killed. I don't want to be the cause of puttin' no
such look on any woman's face. I've knowed all
these years though that my time must come sooner
or later. I heard to-day that the Wrights have got
in a lot of liquor from Tarpon Springs an' they are
sayin' that the last Turner has got to be wiped out
of Judson. So, I got me in a store of water an'
grub an' fixed to lay low for awhile. I may be able
to hold out until their liquor is gone an' the danger
is past, but I reckon hit doan' make so powerful
much of difference. They air plum' sho' to get me
sooner or later. Wall, that's the story, young fellows,
hit's been a right smart relief to have someone
sympathetic to tell hit to. Don't you worry none
though. As soon as comes mornin' I'll hist a flag
of truce an' arrange to have you fellows let out
peaceful. You can take my boat an' go after your
captain an' that little nigger, but I sho' advise you
not to stop hyar on youah way back. Keep right
on to Tarpon Springs. Some of my kin folks kin
bring the sloop back from thar."</p>

<p>"You are very good," Charley exclaimed. "But
tell me why you have never left this awful place.
There are hundreds of places where you could have
made as good a living and been free from dread and
worry."</p>

<p>"Mammy's grave is out thar among them pines,"
said the man, simply, "an' daddy's, an' Ben's, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Abe's, then, atter all, this place is home, no other
place could be that."</p>

<p>"I see," said Charley, much abashed.</p>

<p>"I am proud to have met you, Mr. Turner," declared
Walter, warmly. "I think you are a noble
man."</p>

<p>"No? I sho' reckon you is mistaken," said the
man in surprise. "Me noble? I reckon not. My
own kin 'lows I'm mighty poor-spirited 'cause I
won't take no hand in the killin'."</p>

<p>"I don't care a cent what your kin says," began
Walter, hotly, but he was interrupted by the crack
of a rifle, the whistle of a bullet, and the howl of
a dog outside.</p>

<p>His host winced as if the bullet had struck his
own body. "They've killed Bet," he cried. "Bet,
what I raised from a little bit of puppy. They
hadn't ought to go an' shoot a poor defenceless,
dumb animal, hit ain't right. My God, be they goin'
to kill all my poor faithful dawgs," he cried, as another
shot rang out followed by another pitiless
howl.</p>

<p>Rifle shot followed rifle shot while the man stood
trembling with eyes flashing as he listened to the
whining of the animals outside. At last, heedless
of the bullets pattering against the logs, he flung
the door wide open and called to the hounds. They
came crowding in, a whining, mangy, ill-looking
pack, but disreputable as they were, they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the man's only friends through his lonely years and
the two lads respected him for his act.</p>

<p>As soon as he had bolted the door again, he rummaged
in a corner and brought out three rifles. He
handed one to each of the boys. "I reckon, we'll
have to watch at the loopholes now the dawgs air
inside," he said quietly. "You-alls can take the
ones at the ends, I'll tend to the sides. Be right
careful 'bout standin' in front of 'em, a bullet might
pass through. An' don't shoot to kill if you can
help it."</p>

<p>"An' his kin people call that man poor-spirited,"
whispered Walter in wonder to his chum as they
took up their positions.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>BESIEGED.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boys had little opportunity for conversation
in their new rôle as guards, being separated from
each other by the length of the cabin. Strange as
was the position in which they found themselves,
they felt but little fear. The massive logs of which
the cabin was constructed bid defiance to the entry
of a bullet, and neither of them could believe that
the affair would amount to more than a few shots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
being fired at the building while the attacking party
was under the influence of the liquor they had
drank. They believed that with the coming of day
the feudalists would disband and retire to their
homes, while they would be free to return to the
rescue of their friends on the island. Nevertheless,
they were not going to take any chances in the
duties as sentinels. They stood well to one side of
their loopholes and peeped out at the little clearing
plainly visible in the bright moonlight.</p>

<p>"I reckon they can't see to shot through the loopholes,
but you-alls want to keep youah bodies out of
line with them," cautioned Mr. Turner. "Hit
mought be that a stray bullet would pass through
one of them. An' don't either of you young fellows
fire 'less you jes' have to. You doan't want to get
mixed up in this hyar quarrel. If yu' jis' naturally
have to shoot, aim low an' give it to 'em in the
laigs."</p>

<p>"There seems to be several of them gathering together
at the edge of the woods," called Charley
anxiously. "Here they come straight for the
house!"</p>

<p>His host darted to his side. "They've got a long
pole an' air aiming to batter down the door," he announced.
"Keep back, boys, an' let me do the talking
an' shootin', if thar's got to be any."</p>

<p>But the boys crowded close to his side, eager to
view the coming attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>There were about a dozen men in the approaching
party and they advanced at a rapid trot, bearing
between them a huge pine log.</p>

<p>"Halt whar you air," commanded Turner when
they had approached to within sixty feet of the
house. "If you-alls come any closer meanin'
trouble, someone is goin' to get hurt."</p>

<p>There were enough of timid spirits in the party
to cause a halt in the advance.</p>

<p>"We're goin' to get youah hide this time, Bill
Turner," shouted the foremost of the gang, a big,
heavily-whiskered man. "Hit's a disgrace on us
Wrights to have one of youah name livin' still in
this settlement. You're goin' to be done for this
time."</p>

<p>"Now, I ain't done nothin' to you-alls in all these
years," said Turner quietly and argumentatively.
"You ain't got no cause to come 'round hectoring
me."</p>

<p>"More shame for you," shouted the big man.
"We're goin' to do you, first, 'cause you're a
Turner, second, 'cause you've been too poor-spirited
all these years to put up a man's fight."</p>

<p>"Pears lak hit needs a powerful lot of yu to do
fo' one, lone, mean-spirited critter," said Turner,
mildly.</p>

<p>The big man stamped his foot with rage. "Hit
don't take none but me," he roared. "Yu come out
hyar an' we'll have it out, man to man."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't a-doubting you're courage, Jim Wright,"
returned the other, slowly, "but I ain't aimin' to
hurt no man 'less I have to. Besides, if I did get
the best of yu, all the rest of youah gang would
come down on me. Jes' keep away from my cabin,
that's all I've got to say."</p>

<p>"Come on, boys," roared the leader. "He's too
mean-spirited to hurt a fly. He can't shoot all of
us, anyway."</p>

<p>There was some hesitation, but his fellows, evidently,
believed that the man inside would not fire.
Under the urging of their leader they picked up the
log and started on a run for the door.</p>

<p>But they quickly discovered their mistake. From
the loophole shot out quick jets of flame as the man
inside worked the lever of his Winchester. The log
dropped unheeded to the ground as its bearers
broke for the cover of the woods. Some were not
able to run but limped away groaning with pain.
After the fleeing ones strode the big leader, cursing
them for cowards and imploring them to return to
the assault.</p>

<p>"I don't reckon I've hurt any one of them very
much," Turner remarked, as he slipped more shells
into his rifle. "I jes' aimed for their laigs."</p>

<p>"Thank God, it has all ended without loss of
life," Charley said earnestly, but his host shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Hit ain't ended, hit's jes' begun, Jim Wright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
ain't one to be scart out by a little lead. He don't
know what fear is. If he can't get none of 'em to
come back with him, he'll come back alone. I wish
you young fellows were safe outer hyar, but it
won't do for you to try to leave now. Crazy drunk,
like them fellows is, hit wouldn't be safe for you.
Maybe by morning they'll be sobered up enough to
listen to reason."</p>

<p>In spite of his words, the boys were hopeful that
the night would pass off without further trouble,
but they were soon undeceived. Half an hour had
not passed when the big leader emerged from the
woods followed by a half a dozen of his fellow
feudalists.</p>

<p>His followers halted by the fallen log but he advanced
boldly direct for the loophole.</p>

<p>"Keep away, for Gawd's sake, keep away, Jim,"
Turner implored. "I don't want to have to shoot
you."</p>

<p>"Hit's you or me this time!" shouted the other,
"The sun don't rise on no living Turner in this
town."</p>

<p>"Keep back," warned Turner, thrusting his rifle
through the loophole, but even in his desperate situation,
the boys, crowded close beside him, and could
see that he aimed only at the legs of the advancing
man.</p>

<p>Ruffian though he was, the other was not without
brute courage. He never paused in his advance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
"Shoot," he shouted as he whipped out a pistol,
"Shoot, that's what I want yu to do."</p>

<p>The two reports came almost together, but the
pistol shot was a fraction of a second ahead of the
other. Like a fire-swept weed Turner crumpled to
the floor, his rifle exploding as he fell.</p>

<p>The big man clapped one hand to his side and fell
to the ground.</p>

<p>With the report of his rifle, his followers had
grabbed up the log and rushed for the door, but
Charley had been quick to see the danger. Snatching
up the rifle from the fallen man, he fired at the
moving legs as fast as he could work the lever. The
whistling lead was more than the assaulters could
stand. Three dropped their hold on the log and
limped hurriedly for cover while their fellows, deprived
of their aid, could no longer sustain the
heavy timber, which sank again to the ground while
they hastened after their wounded companions.</p>

<p>The boys watched them in silence until they entered
the woods then Charley set down the rifle.</p>

<p>"I don't think they will be back right away
again," he said. "Anyway, we have got to risk a
light. Perhaps Mr. Turner is not dead."</p>

<p>With hands that trembled with excitement Walter
struck a match and lit the lamp, then, the two boys
lifted the prostrate man and laid him upon the bed.
"Keep watch at the loophole while I see if anything
can be done for him," Charley commanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The man's shirt was matted with blood and the
lad did not attempt to take it off, but cut it away
with his sheath knife, exposing the white chest in
the center of which gapped a horrible hole. "He's
badly wounded," he announced after a careful
examination of the wound. "There's two holes,
one in his chest and one in his side. I believe
the bullet struck a rib and glanced, coming out at his
side. If so, he will pull through if I can only
stop the blood flowing. I'll have to keep this lamp
lit for awhile even it is risky. I'll be as quick as
I can."</p>

<p>There was little in the rude cabin with which
to do in such a case, but the resourceful lad made
the best of the situation, working with feverish
speed so as to be able to extinguish the lamp as
soon as possible. First, he washed out the wash
basin thoroughly and filling it with clean water
from the barrel added to the water a generous handful
of salt. With this he washed the ugly-looking
wound, then tearing into pieces a fresh sheet he
found lying on a shelf, he made a little wad of rags
with which, after soaking them in salt water, he
plugged up the gaping hole. Over this he bound
wet strips of the sheet to hold it securely in place.
He was rewarded for his labor by seeing that the
flow of blood was quickly checked and soon ceased
entirely. As soon as he made certain of this, he
extinguished the light and crept to his chum's side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think he will pull out all right," he announced.
"He is unconscious yet, and when he does come to
he'll be very weak from loss of blood. Have you
seen any more of those fellows?"</p>

<p>"They're still in the woods around the clearing.
Listen and you'll hear their voices every now and
then."</p>

<p>"Has the man who was shot moved any?"</p>

<p>"No, he lays just as he fell. I guess he's dead."</p>

<p>"It's a horrible affair," said Charley with a shudder.
"I'll never forget this night. It has put us in
a bad fix. We can't leave here now, and I don't
like the way the wind is coming up. If there's a
heavy storm, the captain and Chris will be in danger,
it wouldn't take a very heavy sea to cover that
marsh. Just listen how it's blowing."</p>

<p>Walter seemed not to hear what his chum was
saying. He stood staring out at the still figure
stretched on the ground. "He hasn't moved, but
maybe he isn't dead," he said at last. "Perhaps, he
is bleeding to death and a little attention might save
his life."</p>

<p>"You're right," Charley exclaimed. "We must
bring him in."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>THE ENEMIES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a risky thing to attempt. To venture outside
would be to expose themselves in the bright
moonlight to the bullets of the feudalists, but the
two plucky lads never hesitated. The body lay not a
dozen steps from the cabin and it would not do to
let his fellows approach that close to the little fort.
Either they must save him themselves, if he was not
already dead, or leave him to die alone in the night.</p>

<p>"We must be quick about it," Charley declared.
"As soon as I unlatch the door, we must run out,
grab him by the shoulders, and drag him in&mdash;he's
too heavy to lift."</p>

<p>In this bold move fortune seemed to favor the
lads. They got their heavy burden to the door before
a shot was fired and, then, the bullets whistled
harmlessly above their heads.</p>

<p>"We were lucky that time," Charley panted as
he barred the door again. "Now keep a sharp
lookout. I'll have to light that lamp again."</p>

<p>"This fellow is not so very badly hurt," he announced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
as soon as he had examined his new patient.
"The bullet has gone right through the
fleshy part of his shoulder. He will come out of it
all right if the wound is kept clean." In a few minutes
he had washed and dressed the wound as he
had the other man's, then, putting out the light once
more, he rejoined his companion at the loophole.
"Anything stirring?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, I don't even hear their voices now. Perhaps
they will not bother us again to-night," Walter
replied, hopefully.</p>

<p>"I am not worrying about them as much as I
am this wind," said his chum gloomily. "We are
safe enough here so long as the grub and water
holds out, but, God knows how it is faring with
Chris and the captain."</p>

<p>The gale was now howling and whistling around
the little cabin with a force to justify Charley's
gloomy apprehension. The boys had to speak
loudly to make themselves heard above its uproar.
They soon abandoned all attempts at conversation
and waited wearily and silently for another assault
from the feudalists and for the coming of day.</p>

<p>Either the ruffians had at last become over-powered
by the liquor they had drank or else they had
decided to wait the coming of day, for they did not
again show themselves in the clearing. Day, however,
came at last, after what seemed to the exhausted
lads an age of waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as it became light enough to see, Charley
removed the bandages from their stricken host and
redressed his wound more carefully. "His pulse is
getting stronger and there is some color in his face,"
he remarked to his chum. "I believe, I could bring
him to, but I guess it's best to let him lie unconscious
as long as he can. He will suffer enough
when he does regain consciousness."</p>

<p>As soon as he finished with Turner, Charley
turned to his other patient who was beginning to
move uneasily and show signs of returning consciousness.
While he was yet bathing his wound
the man opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Gosh! how my shoulder hurts," he growled.
"Be mighty careful how you touch it, young fellow,
or I'll skin you alive."</p>

<p>Charley set aside the basin of water and rising
to his feet looked down on the fellow with a face
full of scorn.</p>

<p>"You great, big, drunken, cowardly murderer,"
he exclaimed. "It's a pity that bullet didn't kill
you. You are not fit to live on God's green earth.
You're shot when trying, with a crowd of your fellows,
to kill a lone, inoffensive man. Your friends
don't think enough of you to come back and get
your carcass. We bring you in and care for you
and instead of thanks, your first words are a growl
and a threat. You are a cowardly, disgraceful
cur,&mdash;that's what you are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Astonished rage filled the man's face. "No man
ever said words like that to Jim Wright and lived,"
he gasped. He attempted to rise but was too weak
to gain his feet, and sank back with a groan.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you won't do any killing for a little
while," sneered Charley, whose anger was at white
heat. "I've no doubt people have been afraid to
tell you the truth before, but you are going to hear
it for once in your life. I've no doubt with your
strength and disposition you've bullied everything
until they are afraid to do anything but flatter you,
but, now you are going to take a dose of your own
medicine." Then, seating himself just out of reach
of the man's powerful arms, he proceeded to tell
him what he thought of him in words that stung
with contempt and scorn. Then, as his anger subsided,
he repeated the story Turner had told him,
contrasting Turner's quiet, patient, peaceful heroism
with the other's blood-thirstiness and violence,
with all the power of the earnestness he felt.</p>

<p>At first the man kept interrupting him with curses
and abuse, but as he went calmly on ignoring the interruptions
the fellow lay quiet, his face turned to
the wall.</p>

<p>Once Charley stopped, thinking he might have
fainted he lay so still, but he spoke up gruffly.</p>

<p>"Did I kill him?"</p>

<p>"No, but it's not your fault that you didn't," the
lad replied, curtly, and went on with his arraignment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
"I don't care a hang what you and your
cowardly fellows think," he concluded, "all decent
people would say that that poor fellow lying there
is a brave hero while you are the mean-spirited,
cowardly one. And, now, if you'll lie quiet and
keep your mouth shut, I'll dress that wound. I hate
to pollute my hands by touching you, but it's got to
be done."</p>

<p>The man lay quiet while the lad washed and
bound up his wound. Charley could see that his
features were working convulsively, but whether
from rage or pain he could not determine.</p>

<p>As soon as his task was completed, Charley relieved
his chum at the loophole and Walter set about
making coffee and cooking some breakfast. They
were both sadly in need of food and felt much
better after they had eaten. As soon as they had
finished, Charley made his chum lie down to take a
nap, promising to call him, and lie down himself in
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>While Walter was asleep Turner came out of the
deep swoon which had followed his wound. He was
weak and in terrible pain but in full possession of
his senses. It was evident that he was greatly bewildered
at the sight of his enemy lying helpless on
the floor, and Charley explained the situation to him
in a few words.</p>

<p>"I sho' am glad I didn't kill him," said the sick
man, thankfully. "I jes' shot at his laigs, the gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
must have gone off when I fell. I am sho' sorry I
hurt you so bad, Jim, I didn't aim for to do hit."</p>

<p>But Wright kept his face turned to the wall and
answered not a word.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced Charley was much puzzled
by the constant sound of hammering coming
from the woods near the clearing. It was evident
their enemies were preparing another surprise but
he could not guess at its nature.</p>

<p>All the morning long the hammering continued,
then shortly before noon there emerged from the
woods an object which caused him at first, to stare
in bewildered surprise, and, then, as it drew nearer
the cabin to send him to shaking Walter, whom he
had let sleep on.</p>

<p>"Wake up! Wake up!" he cried. "We have
got to fight for our lives. Those fellows have built
a heavy breastwork on the front of a wagon and
are shoving it ahead of them up to the cabin."</p>

<p>"Young fellows! help me up and help me to that
loophole," gruffly commanded the wounded man on
the floor. "Don't hesitate," he cried as the lad was
about to refuse the surprising command, "them fellows
have got a couple of sticks of dynamite in that
cart an' if they get near enough to throw it thar
won't be enough left of this cabin to make a good
toothpick. We was aiming to use it last night if
we couldn't get Turner no other way."</p>

<p>Between them the two startled lads got the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
fellow on his feet and supported him to the loophole
where he leaned against the logs, his face
twitching with the pain of his effort.</p>

<p>It was just in time, for the wagon with its burden
of death was scarce a hundred feet away when he
shouted: "Stop where yer are, boys. Thar ain't
no call to throw any of that stuff."</p>

<p>"Is that you, Cap?" called one of the men.
"Why, we 'lowed yer was dead."</p>

<p>"An' I might have been for all of yu fellows,
leaving me to die on the ground like a poisoned
dog."</p>

<p>He paused while a chorus of excuses came from
the men behind the breastwork.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't dead, but it ain't no thanks to yu
fellows," he went on slowly and painfully. "Now,
yu fellows jes' roll that wagon back whar hit came
from an' go home and behave yerselves. Yu fellows
know me an' know I'll do what I say. Hit's
jes' come to me, an' hit's come in a powerful rough
way, that I've been powerful mean, pisen an' onery.
My eyes am sho' opened at last, an' I'm powerful
ashamed of how I've been carryin' on. But hit's all
over now. From now on Bill Turner is my friend,
an' the man that lifts a finger again' him lifts it
again' me, an' me an' my close kin will make this
place too hot to hold him. That's all I've got to say.
Now, go home."</p>

<p>Murmurs of astonishment arose from the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
behind the wagon as they slowly but obediently
backed the wagon towards the woods. Over the
face of the wounded man on the bed stole a look of
joy unspeakable.</p>

<p>The bewildered but delighted boys helped Wright
back to his place on the floor.</p>

<p>"I want to shake hands with you, Mr. Wright,"
said Charley, earnestly. "I am afraid I talked
pretty rough to you."</p>

<p>"I needed hit," said the other as he took the proffered
hand. "Hit's a pity, young fellow, that thar
ain't more like yu down in this neck of thar woods."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<small>THE CASTAWAYS AGAIN.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the boys safe from the danger that had
threatened them, let us return to the castaways
whom we left confronted by that menace, the most
grewsome of all to shipwrecked sailors, the lack of
water.</p>

<p>The sponger captain needed no explanation but
the captain's simple words to realize the terrible
tortures and awful death that awaited them all if
help in some shape did not soon come to their rescue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
His bronzed face grew white beneath it's coat of
tan.</p>

<p>"I am frightfully thirsty, already," he exclaimed,
"Is there no way we can reach the mainland.
Thar's water in plenty thar."</p>

<p>"If we were birds or fish, we might get thar, I
reckon," replied Captain Westfield, "but, being as
we are only human beings, I calculate it ain't no way
possible."</p>

<p>The Conch eyed the raging water that stretched
between the little island and the shore.</p>

<p>"A strong swimmer might make it," he observed,
musingly. "I've swum farther many a time but it
was when I was in a sight better shape than I am
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon a right powerful swimmer might
make it," assented the captain, "but this little fellow
and I are not equal to it, we'd never reach the
land."</p>

<p>"I believe I could do it even now," said the
sponger calculatingly, "but I won't desert yo' two
Yo' saved my life an' I'd be worse than a Greek to
leave yo' here."</p>

<p>"If you can do it, go ahead, man," said the old
sailor. "You can't do us any good by staying.
Better save your own life," but the Conch shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p>"My life ain't worth much, now," he said sadly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
"My little ship's gone, all my brave comrades
drowned, an' everything I had in the world lost.
I've not much to live for now."</p>

<p>"Bosh, man," said the old sailor, "I reckon,
thar's always something for a man to live for as
long as the Good Lord let him live. If thar wasn't
the Lord wouldn't let him live."</p>

<p>But the Conch was not to be comforted, the full
extent of his loss was beginning to make itself felt
as he regained his strength and the full possession
of his senses after his terrible ordeal. He soon
moved a little apart from the two castaways, and,
seating himself on the sand buried his face in his
hands. The two watchers could see the tears trickling
between his fingers and they turned away
greatly moved at that most impressive of sights,
the grief of a strong man, ashamed of displaying
his tears. When they looked again he was on his
knees and his bowed head showed that he was praying.
When he rejoined them, his manner was filled
with the calm and quietness of one who has found
peace for his afflictions.</p>

<p>"I see there is no wood here with which to build
a raft," he observed. "Things look pretty bad,
but they say the darkest hour is just before the
dawn. We must take courage. Yo'r young friends
may return with help at any hour."</p>

<p>The captain shook his head sadly. "Something
has happened to them or they would have been back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
long ago. They cannot return now until the storm
is over."</p>

<p>"It cannot last much longer," declared the Conch,
confidently. "It is losing force now, I believe it
will blow out by morning."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but it will take a long time for the sea to
go down so a boat can live in it, and, in the meantime
we have no water."</p>

<p>"We must not give way to despair," said the
Conch, who seemed like another man after his
devotions. "Let's dig another well right in the
midst of the island, perhaps we can get water fit to
drink."</p>

<p>With but little hope the three fell to work and by
noon had dug a hole to water, but they had only
their labor for their pains, the water was salt, bitter,
and undrinkable. Indeed their labor was worse
than fruitless for their exertions had greatly increased
their thirst.</p>

<p>Chris kindled a fire and roasted some of the turtle
meat and eggs, but the castaways only partook of a
few mouthfuls, as eating seemed but to increase
their thirst.</p>

<p>The Conch had lost his hat when wrecked and
Chris, observing his bare head, set about braiding
him another hat from the green palmetto leaves.</p>

<p>The Sponger watched him with interest. "Do
yo' think yo' could make a water-tight mat of that
stuff?" he enquired, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Golly! I reckon, dis nigger could," declared
the little darkey. "I'se done made baskets ob hit dat
would hold water like a bucket."</p>

<p>"How long would it take yo' to make a mat four
feet square?"</p>

<p>The little negro considered, "I guess I could do
hit in a day."</p>

<p>"Then drop that hat business and get to work on
hit. Work like yo' never did before. There's a
chance, jes' a chance, that it will be the saving of
us. Captain, there is work for us to do. Get the
entrails out of one of those turtle shells. Clean
them out good, pack them full of sand, and stretch
them out in the sun to dry. I've got a plan in mind.
It may fail, but it's worth trying. Be careful not
to break the skins."</p>

<p>It was evident from the man's manner that he
was intensely in earnest and the old sailor lost no
time in asking idle questions but went quickly to
work at the task assigned him. In a short time he
had cleaned and washed out the turtle entrails and
filling them with dry sand stretched them out to dry
in the hot sun. When thus prepared they formed a
kind of small hose some thirty feet in length.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, the Conch dragged
the empty shell down to the water and cleaned and
washed it out thoroughly. Leaving it near the
water's edge, he collected and piled close beside it, a
heap of dry wood. Then he returned to where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Chris was working and fell to helping him by stripping
and preparing the palmetto buds for the little
darkey's nimble fingers.</p>

<p>Just before sundown he carefully removed the
sand from the dried entrails and was in possession
of a long, tough waterproof hose without hole or
break in it.</p>

<p>Night brought no cessation of the strange labor.
A fire was kindled beside the little darkey and he
plaited on by its light while the captain and the
Conch kept him supplied with palmetto strips.</p>

<p>About midnight Chris held up his work with a
weary sigh; "Hit's done," he announced.</p>

<p>"Now for the test," cried the Conch, trembling
with excitement.</p>

<p>Taking the strong, flexible, green mat he hurried
down to the turtle shell which he had filled half full
of sea water. Placing the mat over the top of the
shell, he bound it firmly in place with wisps of
palmetto leaves. Then, cutting a small hole in the
center of the mat, he inserted in it one end of the
strange hose, packing wet sand around it to make it
air-tight. He next coiled down the hose in the edge
of the sea and placed the other end of it in the
empty turtle shell. Then, heaping wood around
the mat-covered shell, he started a fire.</p>

<p>The Captain and Chris at last understood his
plan. With his rude contrivance, he was going to
try to distill fresh water from salt after the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
they do on big steamships with costly and complicated
apparatus. The steam from the heated water
was supposed to escape from the shell through the
hose. In passing through it it would become chilled
when the hose was coiled down in the cold sea
water and, condensing into water again, reach the
other shell fresh and free from salt.</p>

<p>In theory the plan was perfect, but would the
rude contrivance do the work?</p>

<p>The three thirsty watchers fairly held their breath
as they kept the fire roaring around the shell and
awaited results. At last tiny wisps of steam began
to trickle through the closely-woven mat. Tiny
drops of moisture were dropping from the end of
the hose. These grew larger and larger until at last
a tiny stream of water trickled forth.</p>

<p>They danced and shouted for joy. "It works!
It works!" they cried.</p>

<p>But thirsty though they were they had to possess
their souls in patience and wait for the process
worked very slowly. All night they staid by the
shells keeping the fire going. Just at day-break the
Conch gave the command to put out the fire. In
the other shell was several gallons of clear, pure
water. As soon as it had cooled sufficiently they
dipped it up with shells and drank greedily. It was
slightly bitter and tasteless but never did drink taste
better to parched throats. With the satisfying of
their thirst, came hunger and they all made a hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
meal off the roasted meat and eggs left from dinner.
Just as the sun arose they lay down to sleep completely
exhausted but with thankfulness to God in
their hearts. Their greatest danger was past. They
had water and food in abundance, and the storm
was slowly but surely subsiding.</p>

<p>They slept through the long day, awakening only
when the shades of night began to fall. Then after
satisfying their hunger and thirst, they lay down
and slept until morning came.</p>

<p>They opened their eyes upon a clear, still day.
The storm had gone and the sea was growing calm.
Far to the South there showed on the blue water a
tiny patch of white,&mdash;a sail.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<small>THE RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> castaways watched the distant sail with
mingled feelings of joy and suspense. Was it the
boys, or was it merely a strange craft beating up
the coast? Would it pass near the island or would
it go by too far out for them to make their presence
known? These were the questions they debated as
they strained their eyes on the distant patch of
white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing soon became evident to the eager
watchers, the sail was steadily growing larger. Although
the storm had passed and the sea subsided
there was still a brisk breeze blowing and each passing
hour brought the stranger craft visibly nearer.
No thought of breakfast entered the castaways'
minds, all their attention was fixed on the approaching
sail.</p>

<p>At last it became evident that the vessel was a
small sloop, that it was headed directly for the
island and that it was rolling and pitching frightfully
in the still heavy seas.</p>

<p>On it came, plunging and tossing like a frightened
steed and sending showers of spray from its
cut water. At last it was close enough to discover
two figures on its decks, one at the wheel, the other
forward, tending the jib sheet.</p>

<p>"Hit's Massa Charley and Massa Walter,"
shouted the sharp-eyed Chris. "Praise de Lawd,
Praise de Lawd," and his over-joyed companions
shouted a fervent "Amen."</p>

<p>The sloop came steadily on, passing the island
and rounding up under its lee as near as its young
captain dared to approach. Anchor was dropped,
sails lowered, and launching a small boat it carried
on deck, its crew of two came sculling for the shore.</p>

<p>And what a demonstration of joy there was
when it grounded on the sands and the chums so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
long separated and so long beset with perils were
once more reunited. Such hand-wringings and congratulations,
and eager questions and chorused answers.
All happy. All excited. All talking at
once, and no one making himself thoroughly understood
in the general clamor.</p>

<p>But Charley soon interrupted the talk-feast.
"We will be here all day at this rate," he said,
laughing. "We had better get on board and get
under way. That sloop is pretty old and cranky for
these waters and we'd better get back as soon as
we can for fear another squall will come up. We
can tell our stories on the way."</p>

<p>The suggestion was wise and as none cared to
linger long on the dreary little island which had
been the scene of so much anxiety and suffering,
there was no delay in carrying it out. All climbed
into the little boat and were carried out to the sloop.
Her sails were hoisted, her anchor weighed, and
her bowsprit headed South for Tarpon. Down in
the sloop's cabin the castaways found a hot meal of
ham, eggs, potatoes and coffee waiting for them,
which Walter had prepared as a pleasant surprise.
In their excitement they had forgotten they were
hungry, but they remembered it now and fell upon
the tasty food with appetites that only left bare
dishes when satisfied, at last. The boys had brought
a pile of clothing with them, and after a wash-down
in cool sea water, the castaways threw away their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
soiled, tattered garments, and, fed, washed, and
freshly clothed, felt like new men.</p>

<p>The Captain's eyes danced with joy when Walter
presented him with a pipe and tobacco he had
brought with him.</p>

<p>Later all gathered around the wheel and stories
and experiences were exchanged, but the reader is
already familiar with the most of them.</p>

<p>"Even after the trouble was all over we couldn't
get away at once," Charley said, concluding his tale.
"I can tell you we were worried to have to lay
around and wait for the storm to pass, knowing that
you and Chris must be in danger on the island. The
people were awfully good to us after the feud was
ended. They could not do enough for us. They
even wanted to give us money, but of course we
couldn't take that. As soon as the wind went down
we borrowed this boat of Mr. Turner and started
out. We are to leave her at Tarpon and he will get
her from there."</p>

<p>"Well, all's well that ends well, I reckon," said
the captain, puffing in supreme content. "We are
safe an' well now an' while we ain't got much
money, we will have the 'Beauty' as soon as she
comes into port, an' she's jes' the same as two thousand
dollars in the bank."</p>

<p>"And we will have another try for that gold
when we get her," Charley declared. "I figure
that those fellows had to cast loose during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
storm and scud before it. They could not ride it
out at anchor. Now that the buoy's gone, it will
take them a long time to locate the gold again. We,
knowing the latitude and longitude can get back
to the spot before they can find it and get all the
gold removed, if we can get a revenue cutter at
Tarpon, as I think we can."</p>

<p>The Captain's face was filled with dismay. "I've
clean forgot the figures, boys," he exclaimed. "I
put it down in the log all ship-shape, the latitude and
longitude, but I've clean forgot what it was. I
ain't got no memory for figures."</p>

<p>It was a heavy blow for the golden-hopes of the
two boys and a silence of disappointment followed
the old sailor's announcement.</p>

<p>"It's no use crying over spilt milk," said Charley,
at last, cheerfully. "We have still got the schooner,
and, with the money we get from her, we can make
a good start at something else."</p>

<p>"You have still good cause for rejoicing," observed
the sponger captain. "You will still have
your vessel, but I have lost my all."</p>

<p>The two chums were not the boys to give way to
repining and they were soon again as bright and
cheerful spirits as if their brightest hopes had been
realized.</p>

<p>It was midnight when the little sloop at last crept
into the harbor of Tarpon. It was useless to go
ashore at such an hour so the little party made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
everything snug aboard and turned in on deck for
a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>They were up early next morning, and, after a
hasty breakfast, hurried ashore to notify the Commissioner
of their arrival and get him to take steps
for the seizure of the "Beauty" as soon as she
reached port.</p>

<p>Mr. Driver was standing out in front of his
store as they came up the street. Amazement and
incredulity filled his face when he sighted them.</p>

<p>"You!" he cried, "Why, I thought you were all
at the bottom of the Gulf."</p>

<p>"No, we are slightly disfigured but still in the
ring," laughed Charley as he shook hands. "Our
schooner has not come in yet, has she?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driver stared at him for a second. "There's
a mystery here," he declared. "Come on into the
store, and let's hear your story."</p>

<p>Seated in the store's little back room, Charley
recounted their adventures while Mr. Driver listened
attentively. When he had concluded, Mr. Driver
remained silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"I hate to be the teller of bad news," he said, at
last, "but you must learn it, and it had better come
from a friend. Your schooner is lost with all hands
on board."</p>

<p>"Lost!" cried all together.</p>

<p>"Yes, she went down at anchor during the storm.
The Greek sponger 'Zenephone' was passing when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
she went under. Not a man was saved. Every one
on the 'Zenephone' wondered why she did not scud
before it instead of hanging to her anchor. I understand
now. They did not want to leave the
neighborhood of the gold."</p>

<p>It was a heavy blow. At one sweep they were
robbed of their all. The little band of chums sat
paralyzed with grief, looking helplessly at each
other. Mr. Driver arose quietly and closed the door
softly behind him, leaving them alone with their
grief.</p>

<p>For a few moments no one spoke. "It's hard,
but it must be met," sighed Walter at last. "What
are we going to do? We have nothing left now,
not even the clothes we wear."</p>

<p>"God knows," answered Charley, hopelessly, at a
loss for once. "I suppose we will have to hunt
work at something or other."</p>

<p>"And likely be scattered and separated for the
first time in years," exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>"That's the worst of it," agreed Walter, sadly.
"I don't mind working but I hate for us all to
have to drift apart."</p>

<p>"Me too," wailed Chris. "Golly! I don't want
to be with no one but you-alls."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the 'Beauty' is lost," Charley
declared. "I believe this is just another of Manuel's
tricks. He is as sharp a rascal as ever lived. I'll bet
she is safe and sound somewhere and that Manuel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
just bought the Greeks on the 'Zenephone' to tell
that story."</p>

<p>"Maybe," admitted the captain, doubtfully.
"The story rings true, though. It would have been
likely for them to hang to their anchor by the gold."</p>

<p>"And it would be just the kind of details Manuel
would think of, knowing we would be more likely
to believe the story if we escaped alive. He is an
artist at rascality."</p>

<p>"Even if you're right, I reckon it won't help us
much," said the old sailor. "The story's tied our
hands all right. The Commissioner won't do anything
just on our suspicions, an' we ain't got any
money to do anything ourselves."</p>

<p>"I feel that Charley is right," Walter declared,
"but we've got only one chance to prove it. Get to
work, get some money and hire a Greek detective to
look into the matter for us. The first question is,
what can we do to earn money?"</p>

<p>They were engaged in a fruitless discussion on
this point when Mr. Driver entered. He heard
their discussion with sympathetic interest.</p>

<p>"There is no work around here," he declared.
"The Greeks work cheaper than an American can.
It's hard for an American to earn a bare living here.
I understand from what you say that you do not
want to be separated. I might find work for one of
you, but I couldn't for all. There is only one suggestion
I can make in such a case."</p>

<p>"Please give it to us," Walter requested.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>CONCLUSION.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Well</span>," said Mr. Driver, "there is a large fish-house
at Clearwater, twenty miles below here. You
probably could get a job fishing for it. You could
all work together then. It is hard, dirty work but
there is pretty good money in it if a man works
hard."</p>

<p>The chums exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"I believe we will try it," Charley said. "Of
course we will have to talk it over before we decide,
but there does not seem to be anything else we can
do."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Driver, "I'll give you a
letter to the fish boss, I know him personally. And
you'll need a little money to pay your fares there.
You can return it when you get to earning."</p>

<p>The chums thanked the kind-hearted storekeeper
for his advice and assistance and adjourned to the
sidewalk where they discussed the matter earnestly.
It did not take them long to decide to follow Mr.
Driver's suggestion. They bid good-bye to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
sponger captain, who decided to remain in Tarpon
and try to get service on one of Mr. Williams'
schooners, and, accepting the loan of ten dollars,
which Mr. Driver pressed upon them, they boarded
the first train going South and soon landed in the
little town of Clearwater. And there, we must leave
them for the present.</p>
